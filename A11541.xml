            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE meanes whereby men from time to time haue bene preferred euen to the higheſt degrees of greatnes and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, haue euer bene and are of two ſortes, Armes and Letters: weapons &amp; bookes, as may moſt plainly bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of antique and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne hiſtories. Let it not ſeeme ſtrange vnto anie man that I haue placed Armes before Letters, for in truth I haue found by obſeruing the courſe of times, and by comparing the occurrents of former ages with thoſe which haue fallen out and followed (as it were by ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in later yeeres, that the firſt Princes and patrones of people did obtaine their titles and dominions by force of Armes, and that afterwards learning &amp; vertue did (as it were by degrees) grow and ſucceede for the making and eſtabliſhing of good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, cuſtomes, and lawes amongeſt them. And then did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths begin firſt to flouriſh, when their Princes were like <hi>Minerua,</hi> whom the Poets fained to bee the goddeſſe not onely of ſtudies but alſo of Armes, inſpiring wit into ſchollers, and fauoring thoſe that follow warres. Wherefore knowing that ſuch <pb facs="tcp:11283:5"/> men as endeuour themſelues to attaine vnto the excellencie of anie art or ſcience, are worthie both of praiſe and preferment, becauſe they ſeeke for that onely true nobilitie, which is in deede much more to be accounted of than birth and parentage. I haue beene induced (for the ſatisfaction of ſuch, and other like noble ſpirites, deſirous to imploie either their ſtudies in the profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or their liues in the practiſe of the arte militarie) to beſtowe my paines in the writing of this Treatiſe concerning the Art, exerciſe, and manneging of the Rapier and Dagger, together with the ordering and mouing of the bodie in thoſe actions. A thing I confeſſe in ſhewe the leaſt peece and practiſe (as a man might ſaie) of the arte Militarie, but in verie deed to moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, excellent, and noble practiſe thereof. For when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with my ſelfe how ſome Authors doo write, that hunting, hauking, wraſtling, &amp;c. are things in ſome ſort belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Militarie profeſsion, for that men thereby doo both make their bodies ſtrong and actiue, and alſo learne to marke the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of hils, woods, lakes, and vallies, together with the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and turning courſes of riuers. It ſeemeth vnto mee that I may with farre greater reaſon ſaie that the Arte and exerciſe of the Rapier and Dagger is much more rare and excellent than anie other Militarie exerciſe of the bodie, becauſe there is very great and neceſſarie vſe thereof, not onely in generall warres, but alſo in particular combats, &amp; many other accidents, where a man hauing the perfect knowledge and practiſe of this arte, although but ſmall of ſtature and weake of ſtrength, may with a little remouing of his foot, a ſodain turning of his hand, a ſlight declining of his bodie, ſubdue and ouercome the fierce brauing pride of tall and ſtrong bodies.</p>
                  <p>Moreuer, it doth many times come to paſſe that diſcords and quarrels ariſe amongeſt ſouldiers and Gentlemen of honor &amp; account, the which (when they cannot be accorded &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <pb facs="tcp:11283:5"/> by lawe, learning, and perſwaſion) muſt bee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the truth thereof tried by armes and combat. And therefore he that is wiſe, carefull of his ſafetie, and prouident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt danger, will be at all times ſtored and furniſhed with this honorable vrgent neceſsity, and inſtant ſhortnes of time, he ſhal be conſtrained to expoſe himſelfe vnto euident danger.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore vpon theſe occaſions, and alſo for that I haue bin thereunto requeſted by ſundrie Gentlemen my good friendes, I haue endeuoured to expreſſe in this diſcourſe, and to make plain by pictures all the skill and knowledge which I haue in this art: Exhorting all men of good mindes and noble ſpirites to learne and purchaſe the ſame, not to the end to abuſe it in inſolencies and iniuries, but to vſe it in caſes of neceſsitie for the defence of iuſt cauſes, and to the maintenance of the honour of themſelues and others. For whoſoeuer will followe this profeſsion muſt flie from raſhnes, pride, and iniurie, and not fall into that foule falt and error which many men incurre, who feeling themſelues to be ſtrong of bodie and expert in this ſcience, preſuming thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, thinke that they may lawfully offer outrage and iniury vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anie man, and with croſſe and groſſe tearmes and behauiour prouoke euerie man to fight, as though they were the onely heirs of <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp; more inuincible than
<hi>Achilles:</hi> not remembring how it hath oftentimes happened, that a little wretched man of ſtature by skill and reaſon hath ouercome a vaſt mightie man of perſon, and ouerthrowen the vnweldie maſſe and burthen of his bodie vpon the face of his kind &amp; liberall mother the earth. This manner of proceeding and behauiour doth plainely ſhew that theſe men (although peraduenture they haue learned the vſe of the weapon) haue not yet beene fufficiently inſtructed in the Arte of Armes. For by the rule and precept of this Art, men are taught by how much they are reſolute in courage, and skilful of the vſe of the ſame weapon, by ſo much the more to ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:11283:6"/> themſelues vertuous, humble, and modeſt both in ſpeech &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to be liers, vanters, or quarrellers, for thoſe which in this ſort demeane themſelues, (notwithſtanding their skill or courage) do commonly carry away wounds and diſhonor, and ſometimes death.</p>
                  <p>I haue ſeene and noted in diuerſe partes of mine owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and in other places of the world, great quarrells ſpringing from ſmall cauſes, and many men ſlayne vppon light occaſions. Amongeſt other things, I remember that in <hi>Lieſena</hi> a citie of
<hi>Sclauonia,</hi> it was once my chance to ſee a ſodaine quarrell and ſlaughter vpon very ſmall cauſe betweene two Italian captaines of great familiaritie and acquaintance. There was in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie a fooliſh boy belonging vnto one of the Captaines, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſly forward, &amp; approching neere vnto the other cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, began to touch the hilts of his ſword, wherevpon the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lent the boy a little blow to teach him better maners: The other Captaine (the boies maſter) taking this reprehenſion of his boy in worſe parte than there was cauſe, after ſome wordes multiplyed began to drawe his ſword, the other Captaine in like ſort betaking himſelfe to his rapier did with a thruſt run him quite through the bodie, who falling downe dead vpon the place receiued the iuſt reward of his friuolous quarrell. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the plaine truth in this point, it is not well done either of men or boyes to touch the weapons of another man that weareth them. Neuertheleſſe a man ought in all his actions to ſeeke and endeuour to liue in peace and good agreement (as much as may be) with euerie one: and eſpecially he that is a Gentleman and conuerſeth with men of honorable quality, muſt aboue all others haue a great regard to frame his ſpeech and anſweres with ſuch reſpectiue reuerence, that there neuer growe againſt him anie quarrell vpon a fooliſh worde or a froward anſwere, as it often hath and daily doth come to paſſe, whereupon follow deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, <pb facs="tcp:11283:6"/> cruell murthers, and extreame ruines. Wherefore I ſaie and ſet downe as a moſt vndoubted truth, that it is good for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man to be taught and inſtructed in the Rapier and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not the rather thereby to grow inſolent, or to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to be able and ready in a caſe of iuſt neceſsitie to defend himſelfe, either at the ſodaine, or vpon defiance and in field aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: for at that time it is too late to looke backe and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this ſtudie, as many doo, who hauing appointed the time and place for fight, doe practiſe ſome point or other of this arte, the which being ſo lightly learned and in ſuch haſt, doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in time of need proue but little helpfull or auailable vnto them. But this knowledge doeth more particularly appertayne vnto Gentlemen and ſouldiers that profeſſe and followe warres, for they more than other men, will (for the credite of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the honor of Armes) diſpute and determine with the point of the ſword all points that paſſe in controuerſie, eſpecially amongeſt themſelues, who had rather die than not to haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſatisfaction for euerie worde of preiudice and diſgrace offered vnto them. Now in this caſe I am to exhort and aduiſe men of all ſortes and condition, as well the skilfull as the vnskilfull, not to bee in anie wiſe too ſuſpitious, nor to catch (as they ſaie) at euerie flie that paſſeth by, for in ſo dooing, they purchaſe to themſelues endleſſe trouble, and enter into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons full of danger and diſhonour

                     <p>You ſhall heare. This word <hi>Schermize et Schara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muzare,</hi> to skirmiſh or fence, may be taken either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or particularly. Generally, for euerie kind of fight. Particularly for ſingle combat. and ſo it is taken as often as it is indefinitly ſet downe, and not expreſly. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in this ſenſe, that it doth neceſſarily belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the arte Militarie may many waies bee proued, for in the arte Militarie it is requiſite that a man know how he <pb facs="tcp:11283:9"/> may beſt ouercome his enemie, and which waie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him, &amp; as it were to dallie with him vntill ſuch time as he can eſpie ſome aduantage. Againe, wee doo many times ſee that a great man or a Captaine doeth wrong an inferiour perſon or a ſouldier, who for that they are men of meaner fortune, doo ſeldome by lawe recouer right or credite, wherfore the Prince or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall (after that the partie wronged hath done his dutie, in complaining vnto him of the iniury receiued) ought to require and command him by whome the wrong was done, either to make ſatisfaction vnto the partie wronged, if the fact were againſt reaſon, or by waie of diſgrace, or elſe to fight the combat with him. Then (being to accept one of theſe conditions) if hee trie the combat, he can neuer acquite himſelf without danger and diſhonour, if hee haue not firſt learned this noble ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, if a man follow the warres and conuerſe with Captaines, and incurre a quarrell, and haue no knowledge of this arte, what ſhifte ſhall hee make? Or how ſhall hee behaue himſelfe beeing challenged the combat for his Countrie or his Prince, which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happened, not onely in the time of the Romanes, but in our dayes, as we may reade in the life of Charles the fifte, and of other Emperours: <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> and <hi>Guicciardino</hi> do make mention of many combats fought in the kingdome of Naples betweene French-men and Italians for theyr Countrie, whereunto were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and choſen moſt famous and skilfull men both of the French and Italian Nation. Wherefore a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or a Generall is not perfectly accompliſhed in all pointes appertaining to his place and profeſsion, if hee <pb n="3" facs="tcp:11283:9"/> bee disfurniſhed of this ſcience: for admit (as it may fal out vpon many occaſions concerning his Country and his owne honour) he bee challenged the combat, and chance to be ouercome therein, although hee haue bin renowmed for infinite victories, hee hath now loſt in one moment all his foregotten glorie, for both the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the fight, and the triumph of the victorie doth wholy redound vnto him who hath ouercome in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Neither were his many victories gotten in the field vnto him more glorious, than this one foile in ſingle fight is diſhonourable, for thoſe victories had many helpes, as horſe, armour, opportunitie of time, aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of place, &amp;c. Thoſe glories many parteners, as ſouldiers and vnder officers, but this diſhonour doeth wholy fall vpon himſelfe, as purchaſed by ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in himſelfe, as namely for want of this ſcience, without the which no man profeſsing the Arte Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, can bee called perfect in his profeſsion, but rather maimed in the principall part thereof, and moſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſafety and defence of a mans owne life, for this is a braunch of that wiſedome which holdeth the firſt place and chiefeſt preheminence in matters of warre, for he that is deuoid of art and skill, doth raſhly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his enemie, and ſo is ſlaine with ſcorne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>

Others are ſo head-ſtrong and raſh, that they doo lyke rammes which kill themſelues by running full but at theyr enemies. But to haue recourſe vnto the firſt and higheſt cauſe, theſe actions are euermore directed by the ſecret will of God, and are the executions of his hidden iudgements.</p>

                     <p>Let vs omit therefore as a ſpeciall and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie cauſe, that ſometimes God ſuffereth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittteth the contrarie: and take this for an infallible rule and grounde, that euerie one renounceth and forſaketh that helpe which God hath appointed, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as hee deſpiſeth and contemneth this Arte, and that God hath giuen vs wit and vnderſtanding to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne and knowe the good and the badde: which <pb n="4" facs="tcp:11283:10"/> beeing ſo, it muſt needes followe, that if a man will not defend himſelfe nor doo his beſt to obtaine victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he muſt be ouercome although his quarrell and cauſe were moſt iuſt and reaſonable, becauſe he will not vſe the meanes which God hath appointed, and therefore muſt blame himſelfe only for his ill hap and ſucceſſe. Wherefore it cannot be denied but that this knowledge and skill which groweth and riſeth from this art of Defence is neceſſary. And therfore I ſay that when vpon iuſt ground and occaſion a man ſhall take a quarrell in hand, and ſhal haue courage, reaſon, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and force to maintaine it, hauing alſo the meanes and helpe of this art, it will ſeldome or neuer chaunce but that he ſhall ouercome his aduerſary, and vpon this reaſon and ground proceedeth my argument. But when he forſaketh the fauour and benefit graunted by God, in that he wil not learne how to defend himſelfe: if the quite contrary happen to him he muſt impute the fault and blame to himſelfe. And therefore I muſt tell you this alſo, that he hath moſt neede of this art which lacketh courage and ſtrength, becauſe that by this art and practiſe he groweth in vre with his weapon, and to haue skill and iudgement to defend himſelfe. And this alſo I ſaye, that ſtrength and valiant courage is not it which giueth victorye, but a skill and knowledge in the vſe of his weapon, and a certaine nimblenes and actiuitie aſwell of the body as of the hand and the foot.</p>

                     <p>In ſooth by that which you ſay, it ſeemes to me that nature is ſhe which worketh and perfourmeth all, and not art, becauſe that from nature commeth cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, force, and a right frame and aptnes of the body, therefore he which ſhalbe furniſhed with theſe partes <pb facs="tcp:11283:11"/> and ſhall vndertake a right and iuſt cauſe, is like to beare away the victory without hauing any or very little skil in the art of Defence.</p>

                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>Certes we may graunt, that nature may doo very much to frame a man apt and fit for this exerciſe, both in reſpect of conuenient courage and ſtrength, but all theſe abilities and giftes which nature can beſtow on a man, are nothing except he haue knowledge or arte, for we ſee that the very thinges themſelues which are brought foorth by nature good and perfect, if they be not holpen by arte, by very courſe of nature become naught and vnprofitable. As the Vine if it be not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by art comes to no proofe nor profit, ſo likewiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trees how apt ſo euer they be to bring forth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent frutes, if they are not husbanded growe wilde, and degenerate from their naturall perfection. Suppoſe that nature bring foorth a moſt goodly and beautifull tree, if it begin once to growe crooked and be not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it looſeth all his beautye, and therefore as you ſee, arte is an aide and helpe to nature: ſo that one hauing thoſe good partes and abilities by nature before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet not knowing them, he cannot vſe them to his benefite but by the meanes of skill and iudgement, which a man by his induſtrie and practiſe attaineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And although he may ſtrike right and croſſe blows and giue the foyne and thruſt, yet theſe being not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reaſon and skill, may as well harme him as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or procure him any aduantage: but art which imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and perfiteth nature, if a man apply his minde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by many experimentes and much practiſe, will make him skilfull and capable of great perfection. And to proue that this is true, we ſee little infants which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <pb n="5" facs="tcp:11283:11"/> as ſoone as they are borne they haue a tung, yet they cannot ſpeake, and after when they haue learned to ſpeake, yet they want eloquence: nature maye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe a gift of memory, which when it is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with art and knowledge, they are able in good ſorte to expreſſe their minde and conceipt. How can you be skilfull in riding if you haue not learned the arte, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may helpe, but not bring to perfection: how is it poſſible that you ſhould proue a skilfull Carpenter or Saylor, if you haue not by practiſe acquainted your ſelfe with thoſe thinges which appertaine thereunto? how can a man be a profeſſour in any art or ſcience, vnleſſe he haue learned it firſt himſelfe? and therefore they which make ſo ſmall reckoning of art, in my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and conceipt in this reſpect are worſe than beaſtes, eſpecially thoſe which are practiſed in fight, in which a man may perceiue a kinde of reaſon and arte, and for proofe of this, take a young Dog which hath not been accuſtomed to fight, and ſet him on a Bull, and you ſhal ſee him aſſaile him with more courage and fiercenes then another which hath beene beaten and practiſde in the matter, but you ſhall ſee him by and by hurte and wounded: whereas in the other you ſhall ſee the quite contrary, for before he ſet vpon his aduerſary you ſhall ſee him ſpie all aduantages that maye be, and hauing found his aduantage he wil after make an aſſault; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe braggers which without iudgement and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will take vpon them to kill the whole worlde, at the leaſt wiſe ſhould order and gouerne themſelues more diſcreetely then beaſts: and if they being without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can help themſelues with art which is taught them? how much rather ſhould a man which is indued with <pb facs="tcp:11283:12"/> reaſon make his profit therof, ſeeke to learne it and not to ſcorne and deſpiſe it, eſpeciallye in ſuch a caſe where ſo deepely it concerneth a mans life, that in the ſtirring of a foote he may be ſoddenlye ouertaken and ſlaine: but the more skill a man hath of his weapon the more gentle and curteous ſhould he ſhewe himſelfe, for in truth this is rightly the honour of a braue Gentleman, and ſo much the more is hee to bee eſteemed: neither muſt he be a bragger, or lyer, and without rruth in his word, becauſe there is nothing more to be required in a man then to know himſelfe, for me therefore I thinke it neceſſarye that euery one ſhould learne this arte, for as a man hath voice and can ſing by nature, but ſhall neuer doo it with time and meaſure of muſicke vnleſſe he haue learned the arte: and as a horſe may be ſtrong and fyt for fight by nature, but can not ſerue a man to any vſe in the feelde vnleſſe he haue beene firſt broken and taught, and framed to be obedient to his maiſters pleaſure and minde: So much more ſhould a man learne how to mannage and vſe his body, his hand and his foote, and to know how to defend himſelfe from his enemy. And heereupon we ſee, that how ſtoute or couragious ſoeuer a man be, yet when he is challenged into the feelde he ſeeks then to learn the skill and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of his weapon of ſome braue and skilfull man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the daye of the fight and combate, and for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe but that he knoweth that it is neceſſarye for him, &amp; that it concerneth his honor and life: and they which affirme the contrary, if euer they haue occaſion to fight, ſhall perceiue to their diſaduantage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, how much they haue erred and bene out of the way: and this which we haue diſcourſed hitherto as I

                     <p>You haue with ſo manye reaſons and proofes ſhewed the neceſſitie of this worthie art, that in truth I greatly eſteeme and honor it, and could wiſh that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of honour would ſeeke to know it and practiſe it, that it might be more eſteemed: but now that I know the excellency of this art, I would gladly know wherein conſiſteth the order and manner to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.</p>

                     <p>Certes my freend <hi>L.</hi> I will not faile in that which I haue promiſed. And therefore I wil begin this ſmall worke, to leaue ſome remembrance of me, with theſe Gentlemen and my good freendes, and with you who are deſirous to vnderſtand it, and eſpecially becauſe I haue alwaies found you to be a louer of gentleman-like qualities.</p>

                     <p>I thanke you ſir for your good will and good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion conceiued of me, and therfore according to the deſire which you haue to make me vnderſtand this worthie arte, I require you to tell me with what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a good teacher minding to make a good ſcholler ought to begin.</p>

                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>So I will, yet I muſt tell you, that I haue ſeene many braue ſufficient men teach with great diuerſitie and diuers ſortes and faſhions of play: and I my ſelfe haue had many teachers, and found them all to differ one from the other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L.</speaker>
                     <p>But I pray you of freendſhip tell me how there can be ſuch diſagreement, ſince that all that art conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in down-right or croſſe blowes, thruſtes, foynes, or ouerthwart prickes.</p>

                     <p>That which you ſay, verilye is true, but conſider
<pb facs="tcp:11283:13"/> alſo that we ſee many precious ſtones, and yet the one to be more eſteemed then the other, although they be of the ſame ſorte and kinde: and we ſee many excellent men which ſtudie the ſame art, and yet one is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed then the other, as well ingrauers as Painters: the ſame is ſeene amongſt learned men, all are learned, but one better learned then the other: and the like is to be ſeene in all ſciences and artes, and ſo in this noble art God hath giuen more to one, then to another. I will begin therefore to tell you how that of many that teach, ſome begin and enter their ſchollers with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and Dagger, ſome with the Rapier and Cloake, ſome with the Rapier and Buckler, and ſome with the Rapier alone: ſome after one ſorte and ſome after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it not all one for a ſcholler to begin with the Rapier alone, or with the Rapier and Cloake, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weapon: may not he become a braue man, as well with one weapon as with an other?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely, they may proue well, but not ſo well as thoſe which begin with the true ground, the which ſchollers ſhould learne of good maiſters, and teachers ſhould with all diligence teach their ſchollers.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L.</speaker>
                     <p>And what I pray you is this ground?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>The true foundation verily and the true begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from whence you may learne all thinges belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this art, is the Rapier alone, and from it will I begin, and you ſhal perceiue of what great importance this beginning is, and how without it hardly or neuer any commeth to true skill and perfection: yet proceed you to aske ſuch queſtions as you ſhall thinke beſt, and take good heede to that which I ſhall ſay, for I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11283:13"/> will beginne as I tolde you.</p>

                     <p>In truth M. <hi>Vincent,</hi> although as yet I haue no great skil, yet me thinkes you haue reaſon in your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that you haue got the right and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this ſcience, and therefore I praye you ſhew me the reaſon why the Rapier alone is the ground and beginning of this art.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>The reaſon as I take it, is becauſe that amongſt Knightes, Captaines and valiant Souldiours, the Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is it which ſheweth who are men of armes and of honour, and which obtaineth right for thoſe which are wronged: and for this reaſon it is made with two edges and one point, and being the weapon which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Noble men, Knightes, Gentlemen and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours weare by their ſide, as being more proper and fit to be worne then other weapons: therefore this is it which muſt firſt be learned, eſpeciallye being ſo vſuall to be worne and taught. In my diſcourſe therefore of this fight of the ſingle Rapier I will ſpeake onelye of three wardes.</p>

                     <p>Tell me I pray you firſte how it is beſt to holde a mans Rapier in his hand, and how to ſtand vpon his garde.</p>

                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>For your Rapier, holde it as you ſhall thinke moſt fit and commodious for you, but if I might aduiſe you you ſhould not holde it after rhis faſhion, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſecond finger in the hylte, for holding it in that ſorte, you cannot reach ſo farre either to ſtrike di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or croſſe blowes, or to giue a foyne or thruſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your arme is not free and at liberty.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L.</speaker>
                     <p>How then would you haue me holde it?</p>

                     <speaker>V,</speaker>
                     <p>I would haue you put your thumbe on the hylte, <pb facs="tcp:11283:14"/> and the next finger toward the edge of the Rapier, for ſo you ſhall reach further and ſtrike more readily.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>L.</speaker>
                     <p>You haue fully ſatisfied me concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but I pray you proceede and ſhew me how I muſt ſtand vpon my garde, or aſſaile myne enemy.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>So I will, and as before I haue tolde you of diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of teachers and varietie of wardes, ſo in this poynt alſo muſt I tell you that mens faſhions are diuers, for ſome ſet vpon their enemies in running, and there are other which aſſaile them with rage and furye after the faſhion of Rammes, and both theſe ſortes of men for the moſte parte are ſlaine and come to misfortune, as may be ſeene in many places of ſuch like fights. Which I ſpeak not as though thoſe two fightes were not good for him which knowes how to vſe them, becauſe that ſometimes they are very neceſſary, according as a man findes his enemy prepared with his weapon: but then they muſt be doone with time and meaſure, when you haue got your enemye at an aduantage, with great dexteritie and readines. But as for me I will ſhewe you the wardes which I my ſelfe vſe, the which if you well marke and obſerue, you cannot but vnderſtand the art, and withall keepe your bodye ſafe from hurte and danger.</p>

                     <p>At this preſent I take wonderfull delight in your companye, and nothing pleaſeth me ſo much as this diſcourſe of yours, to heare you giue me the reaſons of thoſe things which ſo much concerne the life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a man: wherefore performe that which you haue promiſed, wherein you ſhall not onelye pleaſure mee, but many other gentlemen and Noble-men will thinke themſelues to haue receiued a fauour at your

                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>That which I haue promiſed you I will now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, therfore I ſay, that when a teacher will begin to make a Scholler, (as for me I wil begin with the ſingle
<figure>
                           <figDesc>depiction of two formally dressed men duelling with rapier</figDesc>
                        </figure> Rapier, and at this weapon will firſte enter you, to the ende you maye frame your hand, your foote, and your body, all which partes muſt goe together, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you can ſtirre and moue all theſe together, you ſhall neuer be able to performe any great matter, but with great danger) I come therefore to the point and ſay, that when the teacher wil enter his ſcholler, he ſhal <pb facs="tcp:11283:15"/> cauſe him to ſtand vpon this ward, which is very good to bee taught for framing the foote, the hand, and the body: ſo the teacher ſhall deliuer the Rapier into his hand, and ſhall cauſe him to ſtand with his right foote formoſt, with his knee ſomewhat bowing, but that his bodye reſt more vpon the lefte legge, not ſtedfaſt and firme as ſome ſtand, which ſeeme to be nayled to the place, but with a readines and nimblenes, as though he were to performe ſome feate of actiuitie, and in this ſorte let them ſtand both to ſtrike and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Now when the maiſter hath placed his ſcholler in this ſorte, and that the ſcholler hath receiued his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier into his hand, let him make his hand free and at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, not by force of the arme, but by the nimble and ready mouing of the ioynt of the wriſte of the hand, ſo that his hand be free and at libertie from his body, and that the ward of his hand be directlye againſt his right knee: and let the teacher alſo put him ſelfe in the ſame ward, and holde his Rapier againſt the middeſt of his ſchollers Rapier, ſo that the pointe be directlye againſt the face of his ſcholler, and likewiſe his ſchollers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his, and let their feete be right one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then ſhall the maiſter begin to teach him, mouing his right foot ſomwhat on the right ſide in circle wiſe, putting the point of his Rapier vnder his ſchollers Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and ſo giuing him a thruſt in the belly.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>L.</speaker>
                     <p>And what then muſt the ſcholler doo?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>At the ſelfeſame time the ſcholler muſt remoue with like meaſure or counter-time with his right foote a little aſide, and let the left foote follow the right, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a little his bodye on the right ſide, thruſting with the point of his Rapier at the belly of his teacher, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <pb n="9" facs="tcp:11283:15"/> redily his hand that the fingers be inward toward the body, and the ioint of the wriſt be outward. In this ſorte the ſaide ſcholler ſhall learne to ſtrike and not be ſtricken, as I alwaies aduiſe the noble-men and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with whome I haue to deale, that if they cannot hit or hurt their enemy, that they learn to defend them ſelues that they be not hurt. Then to make the ſcholler more ready, the teacher ſhall cauſe his ſcholler firſte to part, wherefore he ſhall remoue with his right foote on the right ſide a little in circle wiſe as the maiſter did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the ſcholler.</p>

                     <p>At the ſame time that the ſcholler remoueth his foote, the teacher ſhall play a little with ſtirring of his body, and with his lefte hand ſhall beat away his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers rapier from his right ſide, and ſhall remoue his right foot behinde his left ſtriking a croſſe blow at the head.</p>

                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>When I remoue with my foote and lifte vp my hand, let the ſcholler paſſe with his lefte foote where his right was, and withall let him turne his hand, and not looſe the opportunity of this blow, which muſt be a foyne in manner of a thruſt vnder his Rapier, and let him lifte vp his hand with his ward that he be garded and lie not open, meeting with his left hand the rapier of his teacher, and let him not beat aſide the blow with his Rapier for hee endangereth the point and bringes his life in hazard, becauſe he loſeth the point: But I wil goe forward. At the ſelfeſame time that the ſcholler goes back, the maiſter ſhall play a little, and ſhifting his body ſhall breake the ſame imbroccata or foyne out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the lefte ſide, remouing with his left foote, <pb facs="tcp:11283:16"/> which muſt be carried behinde the right, and withall ſhall giue a mandritta at the head of his ſcholler, at which time the ſcholler muſt remoue with his right foote, following with his lefte, and let him turne his Rapier hand as I haue ſaide, and that the ſcholler ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame time in going backe as the teacher ſhall, to the end that his point maye be toward the bellye of his maiſter, and let him lifte vp his other hand with his ward on high, that he be not ſtricken on the face with the mandritta, or in the belly with the thruſt or ſtocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. Wherefore at the ſelfeſame time that the ſcholler ſhall deliuer the fore ſaide ſtoccata to the teacher, the teacher ſhall yeelde and ſhrinke with his bodye, and beate the ſtoccata outward on the lefte ſide; and ſhall bring his right foot a little aſide in circle wife vpon the right ſide, &amp; ſhall giue an imbroccata to the face of his ſcholler, at which time the ſaide ſcholler ſhal go backe with his right foote a little aſide with the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhall beate aſide the imbroccata of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with his left hand outward from the lefte ſide, and withall ſhall deliuer the like imbroccata of counter-time to the teacher, but onlye to the face, and then the maiſter ſhall goe backe with his right foote toward the left ſide of his ſcholler, in breaking with his lefte hand the ſaide imbroccata outward from the lefte ſide, and ſhall ſtrike a downe-right blowe to his head, becauſe that by beating aſide his foyne with his hand, he ſhall finde him naked and without garde.</p>

                     <p>Yes very eaſilye with a readie dexteritie or nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, for at the ſame time that the maiſter ſhall giue <pb n="10" facs="tcp:11283:16"/> the ſaide mandritta, the ſcholler ſhall doo nothing elſe but turne the pointe of his foote toward the bodye of his maiſter, and let the middeſt of his left foote directly reſpect the heele of the right, and let him turn his body vpon the right ſide, but let it reſt and ſtaye vpon the lefte, and in the ſame time let him turne the Rapier hand outward in the ſtoccata or thruſt, as I haue giuen you to vnderſtand before, that the point be toward the bellye of his maiſter, and let him lifte vp his hand and take good heede that hee come not forward in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſaide ſtoccata, which is halfe an incartata, for how little ſoeuer hee ſhould come forward, he would put himſelfe in danger of his life: and beleeue me, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man which ſhall not vnderſtand theſe meaſures and principles, incurres the danger of his life: and who ſo deſpiſeth theſe grounds which are neceſſarye as well for the ſchoole as the combat, it may bee to his confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; diſhonour, and loſſe of his life: wherefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye one which makes profeſſion of this art, ſhould ſeek to learn them and vnderſtand them.</p>

                     <p>He ſhall ſhift his body a little, and ſhall beate the ſtoccata or thruſt outward from the right ſide, and ſhal <pb facs="tcp:11283:17"/> remoue with his right foote, which muſt bee conueied behinde the lefte, and ſhall ſtrike a rinuerſa at his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers head, as before: and further, to the end his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may haue iudgement to knowe what ſight meanes, with meaſure and time, hee ſhall teach him to giue a mandritta, and to know when the time ſerueth for it.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>V.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, euery man can ſtrike, but euerye man hath not the skill to ſtrike, eſpeciallye with meaſure, and to make it cutte: and heereupon you ſhall ſee manye which oftentimes will ſtrike and hitte with the flatte of their Rapier, without hurting or wounding the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye: and likewiſe many, when they would ſtrike a downe-right blowe, will goe forward more then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſo cauſe themſelues to be ſlaine. Wherefore I ſaye, when the maiſter and ſcholler ſhall ſtand vpon this ward, and that the pointe of the ſchollers weapon ſhall be againſt the face of the teacher, and the pointe of the teachers weapon nigh to the ward of the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Rapier, and that it be ſtretched out, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcholler ſhall remoue with his right foot a little aſide in circle wiſe, and with the inſide of his left hand barrachet wiſe ſhall beate away his maiſters Rapier, firſte lifting his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue it, and let the lefte foot followe the right: and let him turne skilfully his body, or elſe he ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to receiue a ſtoccata either in the face or bellye. Therefore hee muſt take heede to ſaue himſelfe with good time and meaſure, and let him take heede that hee ſteppe not forward toward his teacher, for ſo hee ſhould bee in danger to be wounded: but let him go a little aſide, as I haue already ſaide.</p>

                     <p>I will ſpeake mine opinion of theſe things which concerne a mans life and honour, and firſte I would wiſh euery one which is challenged into the feeld, to conſider that he which challengeth him, dooth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <pb facs="tcp:11283:18"/> to fight with him as a freend, but as an enemye, and that he is not to thinke any otherwiſe of his minde but as full of rancour and malice towards him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you ſee one with weapons in his hand that will needes fight with you, although hee were your freend or kinſeman, take him for an enemye, and truſt him not, how great a freend or how nigh of kin ſoeuer he be, for the inconuenience that may grow therby, is ſeene in many hiſtories both ancient and moderne. But when you ſee the naked blade or weapon, conſider that it meanes redreſſe of wrong, iuſtice, and reuenge: and therefore if he be your freend that will needs fight with you, you maye tell him that you haue giuen him no cauſe, nor offred any wrong, and if any other haue made any falſe report, &amp; that he is to proue and iuſtifie it, that for your ſelfe, if by chaunce without your knowledge you haue offended him, that you are ready with reaſon to ſatisfie him and make amendes. But if they be matters that touch your honour and that you bee compelled to accept of the combat, doo the beſt you can when you haue your weapon in your hand, and conſider that fightes are dangerous, and you know not the minde and purpoſe of your enemye, whome if you ſhould chaunce to ſpare, afterwards peraduenture he may kill you or put you in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of your life, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when you vſe the mandritta or right blowes: for if he be either a man skilfull at his weapon, or fierce or furious, he may peraduenture doo that to you, which you would not doo, (when you might) to him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if hee bee your friend goe not with him into the fielde, but if you go, doe your beſt, becauſe it ſeemeth childiſh to ſaie, I will go and fight, but I will ſpare and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour <pb n="12" facs="tcp:11283:18"/> him. For if you were the valiaunteſt man in the world, and had no minde to doo him anie harme, yet when you ſee the furie and malice of your enemie, you ſhall be forced, as it were, to doo that you thought not to doo, for which you may peraduenture be ſorie, and diſquieted in mind as long as you liue, as well in reſpect of friendſhip, if you kill your friend, as for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the lawes will inflict and laie vppon you, whether it bee loſſe of goods, impriſonment, or death. And on the other ſide, if you be ſlaine or wounded, it is no excuſe for you to ſaie afterward, that you fauoured him &amp; did not ſo much as you might, for in ſuch a caſe euerie man will thinke as he liſt: ſo that if your enemie were the moſt coward and baſe man that might bee, yet he ſhall bee counted the more valiaunt and braue man. Therefore if it happen that ſome friend of yours hath a quarrell againſt you, tell him that you will not haue any thing to doo with him: and fight with your enemie, not with your friend: neither account him your friend that will fight with you: well you may be his friend, but you ſhall finde him to be your enemie. Therefore whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you ſee anie man drawe vpon you, ſtaie not vntill hee doo his pleaſure, and truſt him not, for hee hath not his weapon drawen to no purpoſe: and if in that ſorte he will talke of the matter with you, cauſe him to ſtand aloofe off, and ſo let him ſpeake: for of the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that hath growen thereby wee haue many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as I will ſhew you more at large by and by. I would wiſh that euerie one ſhould beware to offend any man either in wordes or deedes, and if you haue offered of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſeeke to make amends, as a ciuill and honeſt man ſhould, and ſuffer not the matter to grow to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb facs="tcp:11283:19"/> and inconuenience, as wee ſee examples euerie daie, whereby God is highly diſpleaſed. And amongſt others I will tell you of an accident which hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Padoua,</hi> where I my ſelfe was borne, of a maſter of Fence called M. <hi>Angelo</hi> of <hi>Alezza,</hi> who many yeres brought vp, maintained, and taught a nephew of his, in ſuch ſort, that hee became a verie ſufficient and skilfull man in this art. Which his nephew, whereas by reaſon ſhould haue beene louing and faithfull to him, as to his owne father, hauing ſo long eaten of his bread, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from him ſo many good turnes, eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene brought vp by him from his childhoode and infancie, he did the quite contrarie, for his vnckle
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi> yet liuing and teaching ſchollers, hee openly dyd teach and plaie with many, and by that meanes came acquainted with many Gentlemen, ſo that hee ſet vp a ſchoole of Fence, and beganne to teach, entiſing awaie many which were ſchollers of his vnckle <hi>Angelo.</hi> A part truly verie vile, and of an vnkinde vnthankfull man. Whereupon the ſayd <hi>Angelo</hi> complained of this iniury and wrong offered by his nephew, to a gentleman who was his ſcholler and loued him entirely, ſhewing howe his nephew had not onely impaired his credite, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded him of the aide and helpe which he looked for at his hands, hauing brought him vp, as I haue ſaid, and eſpecially being now growen old. Which nephew (as he ſayd) in reſpect of kinred, bringing vp, and teaching of his arte and skill, was bound to haue ſhewed him all friendſhip and curteſie. Heereuppon the Gentleman,
<hi>Angelo</hi> his ſcholler, promiſed to ſeeke redreſſe, although hee was a friende alſo vnto the nephewe of <hi>Angelo.</hi> And ſo, by badde happe, finding the ſayde nephew of <pb n="13" facs="tcp:11283:19"/>
                        <hi>Angelo,</hi> tolde him that for the wrong offered to his maſter and vnckle, he would fight with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall put hande to his weapon: the other refuſed to fight with him becauſe hee was his friend: but the Gentleman tolde him that if hee woulde not defend himſelfe hee woulde runne him thorough: as hee dyd in deede, for whileſt hee ſtoode vppon tearmes, and would not do his beſt to defend himſelfe, he ranne him quite thorough the bodie. Therefore when a man ſees anie one with a drawen weapon, let him take care to defend himſelfe, becauſe it is not a matter of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe. But I thinke verily in this man, that the iuſtice of God and his owne conſcience tooke awaie all cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and wit of defending himſelfe. And this was the ende of his vnthankfulneſſe, which God would not leaue vnpuniſhed. And if all vnthankfull and treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men were ſo ſerued after the ſame ſorte, I thinke there woulde not be found ſo many: and truly of all vices, I take this vnthankfulneſſe to be one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that is incident to man. Therefore to conclude this matter, I woulde counſell and aduiſe euerie one, to giue as ſmall occaſion of offence anie waie vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as may be, and eſpecially vnto his friend, to whom hee is in anie ſorte beholding: but when that hee is forced to laie hande on his weapon, to doe the beſt he can, as well in reſpect of his credite, as for to ſaue his owne lyfe.</p>

Therefore I ſaie, when the maſter and ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſtand vpon this ward, and that the point of the ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers weapon is towarde the face of the teacher, and the point of the maſters without the bodie of the ſcoller to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the right ſide, both of them being vpon this ward, the ſcholler muſt bee readie and nimble to remooue with his left foote, that the point or ende thereof bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the middeſt of his maſters right foot, turning his Rapier hand, and that his point be in imbrocata-wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his teachers Rapier, and that his left hand bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ward of his teacher: and let all this be done at once, by which meanes the ſcholler ſhall come to haue his maſters weapon at commandement, and if it were in fight, his enemies.</p>

                     <p>I will tell you, when you ſtand vpon this ward, if you remoue in a right line, your teacher or your aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie may giue you a ſtoccata either in the bellie or in the face.

And therefore to proceede, I ſaie, that in my opinion and iudgement, it is not good to vſe the right line, whereas in remoouing in circular-wiſe, you are more ſafe from your enemie, who cannot in ſuch ſort hurt you, and you haue his weapon at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: yea although he had a dagger hee coulde not doo you anie harme.</p>

                     <p>Withall my heart, and therefore I muſt tell you of an imbroccata in manner of a ſtoccata, which is verie good and excellent, as well for practiſe of plaie, as for fight, but they muſt be moſt readie both with hand and foot that vſe it: therefore when the ſcholler ſhall find his maſters Rapier in this ward, that it bee helde vpright or toward his face, then the ſcholler ſhall winne ground a little with his right foote, beeing mooued ſomewhat aſide, and withall let him remoue with his left foot, that it be toward the right foot of the teacher, and that your right foot be againſt the middeſt of his left, as I haue ſaid before, and in remouing let him turne his Rapier hand, that the pointe bee conueighed vnder his maſters wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, which being done, promptly and readily his point will be towards the belly of his maſter, which muſt bee followed with the left hand, &amp; let the ſcholler lift vp his hand to the ward that his fiſt be ſomewhat high, and let him take heed that he looſe not his point, becauſe the teacher may giue him a ſtoccata or thruſt in the belly or face, for that he hath loſt his time.</p>

                     <p>He may do the ſelf ſame which I told you before, when I ſpake of the imbroccata deliuered aboue the Rapier, and certainly this is a verie good play when it is performed with good meaſure, and great agilitie and readines. But beſides this, I will now ſhew you the man-riuerſa in this ward. Therfore when the ſcloer ſhal find his teacher with his point ſomewhat at length, that it is not towards his face, but towardes his belly, then muſt the ſcholler with his left hand beat aſide his maſters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, not at the point, but in the ſtrength and middeſt of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11283:21"/> the weapon, and withall muſt remooue with his lefte foot, both which muſt be done at once: and let the ſame foot be againſt the right foot of the maſter, as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the foine or imbroccata, deliuered aboue and vnder the rapier: and the teacher at the ſame time muſt doo the like, remoouing with his right foote, as I haue ſayd before. And as the ſcholler remoues and beates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the weapon, let his left hand be ſodainly vppon the ward of his teacher, and in giuing the ſayde riuerſa or croſſe blowe, let the ſcholler skilfully turne his Rapier hand, that the knuckle or ioynt may be toward the head of the teacher, for otherwiſe he may giue him a ſlicing or cutting blow, which we call <hi>Stramazone:</hi> therefore let him performe thoſe things skilfully and at once, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially let him beware that he doo not beate aſide his teachers weapon toward the point, becauſe he ſhoulde be in danger to receiue a thruſt or ſtoccata either in the face or belly. Beſides, the ſcholler, ſo that he find his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in the ſame ward, that his Rapier bee ſomewhat at length, &amp; not directly vpon the face, may ſtrike the ſaid riuerſa or croſſe blowe at his legs: but beating aſide the Rapier with his hande muſt bee done readily, and hee muſt remoue with his hande in ſuch ſorte, that his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier when the lefte hand beates it by, may be betweene his owne hand and his teachers weapon: and with this readineſſe muſt hee ſtrike this riuerſo, but withall, his lefte hand muſt bee vppon the warde of his teacher.</p>

                     <p>Moreouer, hauing the vſe of your lefte hand, and wearing a gantlet or gloue of maile, your enemy ſhall no ſooner make a thruſt, but you ſhalbe readye to catch his ſwoorde faſt, and ſo commaund him at your pleaſure: wherfore I wiſh you not to defend any thruſt with the ſwoorde, becauſe in ſo dooing you looſe the point.</p>

                     <p>But I pray you, is it not good ſometimes to put by a thruſt with the ſwoord?</p>

                     <p>I will tell you when it is good to vſe the ſwoord: but now I will tell you how to vſe your hand in that caſe, and cheefelye in this warde wherewith I will beginne.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if the maiſter deſire to make a good ſcholler, let him begin in this ſorte, cauſing his ſcholar to place his right legge formoſte, a little bending <pb n="17" facs="tcp:11283:23"/> the knee, ſo that the heele of his right foote ſtand iuſt againſt the midſt of his left foote, holding his ſwoord hand cloſe on the outſide of his right knee, with his ſwoorde helde in ſhorte, leaſt his aduerſarye ſhould gaine the ſame, euer keeping the poynte directlye on the face or bellye of his enemye, and the maſter ſhall diſpoſe of him ſelfe in the ſame manner, as well with his foote as with his poynt.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, you muſt obſerue iuſt diſtance, which is, when either of you ſtand in ſuch place, that ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forward a little, you maye reache one another, and then the maiſter ſhall make a ſtoccata to his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, going aſide ſomewhat with his right legge, and following with the other in manner of a circulare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towarde the lefte ſide of his ſcholler: and ſo hee maye haue the aduauntage if hee take it, within di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the ſcholler ſhall remoue his right legge in counter-time, after the ſame order that his maiſter dooth, anſwering him with a ſtoccata to the belly: but hee muſt take heede not to remoue too much aſide, or retire too farre backewarde, for ſo the one ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hitte, and the other ſhall neuer learne.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, hee muſt beware of comming too much within his iuſt diſtance, becauſe if he hit his aduerſary, hee may bee hitte againe by his aduerſarye: wherfore I will teache you how to offend and defend in the ſame time. As the Scholler parteth in the counter time, hee muſt in the ſame inſtant breake the ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata with his lefte hande, and aunſwere againe with an other: alſo the Maiſter, to make his ſcholler quicke and readye, ſhall vſe to aunſwere him in the ſame time that his ſcholler deliuereth his ſtoccata, <pb facs="tcp:11283:24"/> going aſide with his right legge, and following with the other toward the left hand of his ſcholler, breaking the ſaide ſtoccata with his lefte hand, and ſhall aime the imbrocata at his face, and the ſcholler muſt parte alſo with his right foote toward the lefte ſide of his maiſter circularlye, beating the thruſt with his lefte hand out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward the left ſide, and then he ſhall in like ſort make an imbrocata to the face of his maiſter, and the maiſter parting againe with his right foote aſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the left hand, breaking the ſaide imbrocata with his lefte hande, ſhall thruſt a ſtoccata, as I ſaide before, to the belly of his ſcholler, and the ſcholler in the ſame inſtant ſhall parte with a counter-time with his right foote aſide towards the lefte hand of his maiſter, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it with his left hand downward, and ſhall make a ſtoccata againe to his maſter, and the maiſter therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhall retire a little with his body, breaking the ſaide ſtoccata outward toward his right ſide, parting with his right foote backward to the left hand, and ſhall anſwer with a punta riuerſa, to the head of his ſcholler, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he ſhall parte ſodenlye, ſtepping forward with his left legge before his right, turning his point quickly to the belly of his maiſter, bearing vp the dagger hand, that he be not hitte in the face with a riuerſo, and ſo he ſhalbe well garded: then the maiſter ſhall parte with his right leg, offering him a ſtraight ſtoccata to the head, as in the firſt ward.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe they may learne the iuſt time and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and make the foote, hand and body readily agree together, and vnderſtand the way to giue the ſtoccata <pb n="18" facs="tcp:11283:24"/> and imbroccata right: ſo that theſe principles are very neceſſarye, and will ſerue for the Rapier and Dagger, therefore whoſoeuer will make a perfect ſcholler, let him ſhew the principles in this warde.</p>

                     <p>I perceiue very well, that theſe things which you haue ſpoken of, are to be doon with great agility and quicknes, but eſpecially by the maiſter, if he entend to make a perfect ſcholler, becauſe the maiſter often put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him ſelf in danger, and the ſcholler regardeth him not, neither is his hand firme: and therefore the maiſter muſt be reſpectiue two waies: in ſauing him ſelfe, and not hurting his ſcholler: but (I praye you) are theſe thinges as good in fight, as neceſſary to be practiſed?</p>

                     <p>As ſoone as your Rapier is drawne, put your ſelfe preſently in garde, ſeeking the aduantage, and goe not leaping, but while you change from one ward to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be ſure to be out of diſtance, by retiring a little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if your enemy be skilfull, hee may offend you in the ſame inſtant. And note this well, that to ſeek to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, being out of meaſure, and not in due time, is very dangerous: wherefore as I tolde you before, hauing put your ſelfe in garde, and charging your aduerſarye, take heed how you go about, and that your right foot be formoſt, ſtealing the aduantage by little &amp; little, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying your lefte legge behinde, with your poynt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the poynte of your enemies ſwoord, and ſo finding the aduantage in time and meaſure, make a ſtoccata to <pb facs="tcp:11283:25"/> the belly or face of your enemy, as you ſhall finde him vngarded.</p>

                     <p>Many are of diuers opinions in that pointe, ſome hold that there are foure times, other fiue, and ſome ſix, and for mine owne parte, I thinke there are many times not requiſite to be ſpoken of, therfore when you finde your enemye in the time and meaſure before taught, then offer the ſtoccata, for that is the time when your enemie will charge you in aduancing his foot, and when he offereth a direct ſtoccata, in lifting or mouing his hand, then is the time: but if hee will make a punta riuerſa within meaſure, paſſe forward with your lefte foote, and turne your pointe withall, and that is the time: if he put an imbroccata vnto you, anſwere him with a ſtoccata to the face, turning a little your bodye toward the right ſide, accompanied with your poynt, making a halfe incartata: if hee ſtrike or thruſt at your legge, carrye the ſame a little aſide circular-wiſe, and thruſt a ſtoccata to his face, and that is your iuſt time: and if he offer you a Stramazone to the head, you muſt beare it with your ſwoord, paſſing forward with your lefte legge, and turning wel your hand, that your point maye go in manner of an imbroccata, accompanied with your left hand, ſo that your poynt reſpect the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of your aduerſary, and break this alwaies with the point of your ſword, for of all ſtoccataes, riuerſaes, and Stramazones, I finde it the moſt dangerous. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that whilſte your enemy ſtriketh his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, you deliuer a thruſt or ſtoccata to his face, for the auoiding of which, hee muſt needes ſhrinke backe, otherwiſe hee is ſlaine: and how little ſo euer your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11283:25"/> is wounded in the face, he is halfe vndone and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, whether by chaunce it fall out that the blood couer and hinder his ſight, or that the wound be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as moſt in that parte are: and it is an eaſie matter to one which knowes this play, to hit the face, although euery one vnderſtands not this aduantage. And many there are which haue practiſed and doe practiſe fence, and which haue to deale with thoſe which vnderſtand theſe kinde of thruſtes or ſtoccataes, and yet cannot learn to vſe them, vnles theſe ſecrets be ſhewed them. Becauſe theſe matters are for fight and combat, not for play or practiſe: but I wil come back where I left. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when your enemye maketh as though he would ſtrike at your head, but in deed ſtriketh at your legges, looſe not that oportunity, but either in the falſe proffer that he makes, hit him, or carry your foot a little aſide, that his blow may hit the ground. So when you deale with thoſe which thruſt their pointes downeward, at the ſame time ſtrike you at the face: and when you find the point of your enemies weapon on high, get your point within his, and when you haue gotten this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, immediatly giue him a ſtoccata or thruſt, or elſe let it be a halfe incartata: and take heed when you deliuer your ſtoccata, that you come not forward with both your feet, becauſe if he be skilfull at his weapon, he may meete you with counter-time, and put you in danger of your life: and therfore ſeeke to carrye your right foot together with your hand, being a little fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with your left foote.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, when you finde that your enemy holds downe his pointe, and his hand alofte, ſeeke to ſtand well vpon your garde, that your hand bee ready with <pb facs="tcp:11283:26"/> your right knee ſomewhat bending towards your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and your body ſomewhat leaning on the left ſide, becauſe if your enemye would giue you a thruſt or ſtoccata, hee ſhould come a great deale ſhorte of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching your bellye with his poynte, and eſpeciallye he wanting that knowledge, which thoſe haue who are furniſhed with the right skill of this arte. Wherefore if he giue you a ſtoccata or thruſt in the bellye, you muſt beat it down with your left hand, outward from your lefte ſide, and withall you maye giue him a ſtoccata or thruſt either in the bellye or the face: and if hee make a foyne or imbroccata to your face aboue your head, you muſt be nimble with it, and may beate it aſide with your hand, the inſide outwward toward your left ſide, or elſe without beating it by, deliuer him a halfe incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata with your poynt, which muſt be within his, and let it be towards his bellye, ſo that all theſe be doone with meaſure and time. But if you finde your enemye with his poynt downe, you muſt ſtand vpon a lowe warde, and carrie your body very well, leaning vpon the lefte ſide, and when you haue got him within your propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may giue him a ſtoccata or thruſt, either in the belly or the face, and you are ſafe from his pointe: for if he will make a ſtoccata to you, if you haue skill to beate it aſide with your hand, &amp; to anſwere him again, you muſt needes hit him. And if he giue a foine or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broccata, you may reach him the incartata, as before I haue tolde you.</p>

                     <p>You haue done me a great pleaſure, and I know it will ſtand me in great ſteed if I ſhould haue occaſion to fight, to knowe theſe times and proportions, which are to be obſerued: but I pray you tel me if one, who is <pb n="20" facs="tcp:11283:26"/> skilfull and valiant ſhould aſſaile me, whether this ward be good to be vſed in fight, or elſe whether I alſo ſhould ſtrike and anſwere him with the ſame?</p>

                     <p>If you will do as I will aduiſe you, I ſaie it is verie good either to aſſaile anie, or to tarrie and watch your aduantage, if you haue skill to ſtand vpon it, &amp; to carrie your foot, hand and bodie together, holding your Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſhort and that your point bee towarde the face of your enemie. For if your enemie haue skill in fence, and ſhould not finde you to ſtand ſurely vpon your gard in this aſſault, he might deliuer a ſtraight ſtoccata to your face, not purpoſing fully to hit him, which if you ſhould breake with your Rapier, he might put his vnder yours, comming forward aſide toward your right hande, and might giue you a ſtoccata in the face. Moreouer, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the caſe that your aduerſarie were skilfull and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in fight, and you not much acquainted therewith, if he ſhould not find you vpon a ſure ward, he himſelfe being in proportion, and finding your pointe without his belly, he might reach you a ſtoccata in the belly, or an halfe incartata, eſpecially if he know in fight how to vſe his bodie.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, in theſe aſſaultes, when he is without your right ſide with his right foot, hee might offer a ſtoccata from the outſide of your weapon, and if you breake it with your Rapier, hee may pull his point vnder yours, and withall remoue toward your left ſide with his right foot, and giue you a ſtoccata in the belly, turning skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully his Rapier hand, ſo that his fiſt bee toward his left ſide. Alſo if you ſhould deliuer a ſtoccata to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and that he ſhould breake it with his Rapier, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly you might remoue with your lefte foot, your left
<pb facs="tcp:11283:27"/> hand, waiting on the weapon of your enemie, and giue him an imbroccata or foine vnder or aboue his Rapier, and may bee maſter of his weapon. But if your enemie ſtrike a mandritta at the legges, if you ſtrike it by with your weapon, he may giue you a venew either by ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata or imbroccata. Therefore it is not good for anie man to vſe theſe things preſcribed, becauſe, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſayd, he had need to vnderſtand well his times &amp; proportions, and to know howe with skill to ſhifte and moue his bodie, &amp; to be readie and nimble as well with his foot as hand, otherwiſe, by his owne meanes he may be wounded or ſlaine: ſo that he had need to bee verie cunning and perfect in theſe matters, wherevpon many good maſters do practiſe their ſchollers in theſe aſſalts to make them readie. But I will let them paſſe, and will ſatisfie you concerning the skil of this ward, which you haue required to know. Therefore I ſaie, when you ſhal ſtand vpon this ward, and that you be aſſailed and ſette vpon, keep your point ſhort, that your enemie may not finde it with his, and look that you be readie with your hand, and if he make ſuch a falſe proffer as I ſpake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you being in the ſame ward &amp; in proportion, may with great readines put a ſtoccata to his face, ſhifting ſodainly with your left foot, being a little folowed with the right, and that ſodainly your Rapier hand be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en backe. But if he ſhoulde giue a ſtoccata to your face with ful force from your rapierſide outward, you may a little ſhrink with your bodie &amp; beat his point with your hand outward from your right ſide toward your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, &amp; withall you may ſtrike a riuerſa. Furthermore, if he ſhould pul his rapier within at the ſame inſtant, to be more ſure, you muſt carrie your right foot a little aſide <pb n="17" facs="tcp:11283:27"/> toward his left hand, and with great readines of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertime you muſt put a thruſt or ſtoccata to his face, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your hand moſt nimbly. So alſo in ſuch like aſſalts if your enemie ſhuld come to ſtrike down right blows or riuerſi; do as I haue told you before, in mouing your hand with great readineſſe, and finding your time and proportion. Wherefore I hold this Ward to bee verie good, as well to aſſaile, as for to tarrie and watch for an aduauntage. And you muſt eſpecially take heede that you put not your ſelfe in danger, becauſe if your enemy ſhould finde you without your ſword at length, beeing nimble &amp; ſtrong, ſtriking vpon your weapon, he might make a paſſage with greate ſpeede, and make himſelfe maſter as well of you as of your weapon, and put you in daunger of your life. Whereas contrary-wiſe, when you doo holde your Rapier ſhorte, as I haue tolde you, and that your pointe is towardes his face, you make him afraide, eſpecially when hee comes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with his hand and bodie to finde your weapon with his, he muſt needes come ſo farre that you maye eaſily hurt him without being hurt. Beſides all this, if your enemy ſhould come to deliuer a ſtoccata, imbroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata, mandritta, or riuerſa, you haue great aduauntage, for hee cannot ſo readily ſtrike, nor with ſuch ſuretie as you may.</p>

                     <p>But I pray you tel me this, if mine enemie ſhould charge me with his weapon at length, as putting forth halfe his weapon in his ward, muſt I anſwere him with the like?</p>

                     <p>This warde truely is verie good againſt all other wards in my opinion, eſpecially if you knewe howe to charge your enemy, &amp; to find time &amp; proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtrike <pb facs="tcp:11283:28"/> knowing how to turne and ſhift your bodie as well on the one ſide as the other, and vnderſtanding the skill of fight, and beeing moſt nimble, you may aunſwere him with it. But yet I would haue you to marke and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well in what ſorte your enemie behaueth himſelfe, and howe hee holdeth the pointe of his weapon: if that you finde him holding his pointe alofte, that it bee aboue yours, when that you holde it right againſt his face, you muſt ſeeke to winne grounde a little wyth your right foote before you remooue, and your hande muſt be nimble and readie, &amp; at that verie inſtant make three times with your feet at once, mouing a little with your right foot, a little with your left, and againe a little with your right. But this muſt proceed from very great skill and knowledge, for if your left foot tarrie behind, he may giue you a pricke in the face or in the belly, or a cut vpon the legges. Wherefore you muſt ſo come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with your right foote at once, that you may haue the weapon of your enemie with your hand, and your point towards his belly. So that as you ſee, many &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many things may be performed by this ward, if, as I haue ſayd, one be skilfull and nimble. But this I would aduiſe you, when you would make theſe paſſages, or put your weapon vnder your enemies, that you doe them not in vaine nor without ſome aduauntage. There are many which oftentimes by chance and hap, doe many things in fight, of which if a man ſhoulde aske them a reaſon, they themſelues know not how they haue done them. And ſometimes men verie ſufficient and skilfull at their weapon, are hurt, either by their euill fortune, that they ſuffer themſelues to bee carried awaie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermaſtered too much with choler and rage, or elſe for <pb facs="tcp:11283:28"/> that they make no account of their enemie. Wherefore as well in this ward as in the other, take heede that you ſuffer not your ſelfe to bee blinded and carried awaie with rage and furie.</p>

But I praie you inſtruct me ſomwhat farther, as if at this preſent I were to vndertake a combat with ſome valiaunt man in defence of my credite and my lyfe.</p>

                     <p>In truth the ſecretes which are in like fightes are ſuch, that vnleſſe one haue a skilfull man in this ſcience to inſtruct him, and that loues him, he ſhall neuer come to the right vnderſtanding of them. There are manye which will thinke they knowe inough, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are deceiued: and others there are which the maſter or teacher loues, and ſhewes them faithfullie all that he can, and yet they can neuer come to anie greate matter in this ſcience, but they who are framed of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it were, both in reſpect of abilities of bodie and minde fit to learne this arte, if they vſe the help of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teacher, come to great perfection. And theſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are the gifts of God and nature, wherefore as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo in this worthie arte you ſhall finde ſome more apt than others, and eſpeciallie to giue a right thruſt or ſtoccata, which is the chiefeſt matter of all. For all the skil of this art in effect, is nothing but a ſtoccata: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you ſhall haue occaſion to fight, I could wiſh you to practiſe this ſhort ward, and to ſtand ſure vpon it, &amp;

But if your enemie bee cunning and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, neuer ſtand about giuing any foine or imbroccata, but this thruſt or ſtoccata alone, neitheir it alſo, vnleſſe you be ſure to hit him: ſuffer your enemie to doo what he liſt, onely ſtand you vpon a ſure ward, and when you finde opportunitie and time, deliuer the ſtoccata, and ſhift with your foot. And this alſo you muſt marke, that ſometimes it is good to giue the ſtoccata to the right ſide, which muſt bee doone when your enemies right foot is ouer againſt yours, and ſometimes to the lefte ſide. Wherefore when you will deliuer a ſtoccata to the right ſide, ſee that you go not aſide with your foot, but giue the thruſt, and then ſhifte backward with your left foot, as alſo when you deliuer your ſtoccata to the left ſide, you muſt ſhift aſide with your right foot. Theſe things muſt be knowen &amp; much practiſed. But if your enemie vſe a mandritta or riuerſa, you haue had inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions already how to behaue your ſelfe. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſecrets of this ward which cannot be written nor be made plaine or ſufficiently expreſſed to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode. And that it is ſo, many Gentlemen can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who although they haue ſeene me doo, yet coulde neither vnderſtand nor practiſe them vntill that I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the waie, and then with much adoo and verie
<pb facs="tcp:11283:29"/> hardly. Therefore I thinke I haue ſpoken inough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ward: and if you can perfourme all that I haue tolde you, it will ſuffice, &amp; this our diſcourſe may pleaſure many, which take delight to vnderſtand and learne theſe things: but if they will repaire to the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the arte, they ſhal better and more fully vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and conceiue of all, becauſe both knowledge and practiſe is required.</p>

Becauſe that in this you muſt ſtand with your feet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together, as if you were readie to ſit down, and your rapier hand muſt bee within your knee, and your point againſt the face of your enemie: and if your enemie put himſelfe vpon the ſame ward, you may giue a ſtoccata at length <pb facs="tcp:11283:30"/>

Moreouer, if you would deliuer a long ſtoccata, and haue perceiued that your enemie would ſhrinke awaie, you may, if you liſt, at that verie inſtant giue it him, or remoue with your right foot a little back toward his left ſide, and bearing backe your bodie, that his point may miſſe your bellie, you maie preſentlie hit him on the breſt with your hand or on the face a riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, or on the legs: but if your enemie would at that time free his point to giue you an imbroccata, you may turn your bodie vpon your right knee, ſo that the ſaid knee <pb facs="tcp:11283:30"/> bend toward the right ſide, &amp; ſhifting with your body a little, keepe your left hand ready vpon a ſoddaine to finde the weapon of your enemie, and by this meanes you may giue him a punta riuerſa a ſtoccata, or a riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, to his legs. But to perform theſe maters, you muſt be nimble of body &amp; much practiſed: for although a man haue the skill, &amp; vnderſtand the whole circumſtance of this play, yet if he haue not taken paines to get an vſe and readines therein by exerciſe, (as in all other artes the ſpeculation without practiſe is imperfect) ſo in this, when he commeth to performance, hee ſhall perceiue his want, and put his life in hazard and ieopardie.</p>

                     <p>If you minde to deliuer a ſtoccata like to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, you muſt win ground with your right foot, toward the right ſide of your enemie, and as you finde the time and meaſure, giue him a ſtoccata either in the belly or in the face, and if your enemie ſhrink at that time that you deliuer your ſtoccata, it ſtands vpon you to be moſt readye and nimble, ſhifting with your bodie and weapon, and ſomewhat with your right foote, a little aſide towards the right ſide of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, turning readilie your bodie and knee vpon your right ſide, ſo that your enemie himſelfe ſhal come with his bodie vpon your pointe, and the more furious he commeth, the greater danger ſhall he incurre, becauſe he cannot helpe nor recouer himſelfe. But remember to thruſt alwaies at the face, if you may, for therby you ſhall the better ſaue your ſelfe, and haue the greater aduantage. Moreouer, if your enemie ſhould make a falſe proffer, or deliuer a little ſtoccata, to the ende to procure you to anſwere him, that preſently hee might make you a paſſata or remoue, if you be in good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and meaſure, if he thruſt at you, anſwere him, and if you will you may giue it him full and home, or ſomewhat ſcant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with great agilitie, whileſt he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his paſſata or remoue, turn readie your bodie with your knee, but yet vpon the right ſide, and take heede you ſhift not with your feete at this time, but onelie turne your bodie, as I haue tolde you, otherwiſe you ſhould be in danger of your life, how little ſoeuer you ſhrincke backe: and therefore I aduiſe you to beware that you goe not beyonde that which I haue taught <pb facs="tcp:11283:31"/> you. Morouer, if you can win ground on the right ſide of your enemie, and become maſter of his ſword, you need not thruſt a ſtoccata, but rather paſſe on him with your point aboue his ſword, turning wel your hand as in an imbroccata, or elſe giue him a ſtoccata by a finc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnder his ſwoord hand, which is ſooner done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring to paſſe forward with your left foot toward his right, and ſo let your right foot follow your left: but beware in any caſe that you neuer paſſe directly vpon your enemy, for endangering your life. If your aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thruſt directly to your face within meaſure, anſwer him with a ſtoccata, in the ſame time that he lifteth vp his hande, but if you bee out of diſtance, anſwere not, for then you put your ſelfe in danger. And when your enemie offereth a ſtramazone or back blowe, receiue it on your ſword very readilie, turning your pointe, and paſsing ſpeedly with your left legge, as before taught: but if he make a punta riuerſa, breake it with your lefte hand toward your right ſide, and giue him another: and if he vſe any fincture or falſe thruſt, anſwer him not. Now if your enemie hold his ſword out at length, and you perceiue his pointe to be anie whit without your bodie, eſpeciallie on the left ſide, you muſt charge him, being readie with your lefte hand, ſo that finding his point any whit high, you ſhal falſefie with your ſword hand vnder his Swoorde, paſsing forward with your lefte foote in the ſame inſtant, ſtill following your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie without retiring, for ſo you ſhall be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Swoord, and may vſe him at your pleaſure: but remember to be very redy, for you muſt make but on time, &amp; take good heed that you ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not ſtil in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, for ſo, if your aduerſary haue any skil, he may <pb facs="tcp:11283:32"/> greatlye annoye you, either with thruſtes or blowes. And oftentimes your enemy wil giue ſuch aduantage of purpoſe to haue you paſſe on him: therefore you muſt well vnderſtand what you doo.</p>

                        <p>What is to defend your reputacion, but ſo to hurt your enemye, as your ſelfe may eſcape free? for when you goe to fight, put on this reſolution, either to take away his life, or to cauſe him to acknowledge his faulte, with ſeeking pardon for the ſame, which is more honorable then a blody victory: neither do like children, which in their wanton fighting ſtand farre a ſunder, and make ſemblance to beate one another: therefore note it well, for if your aduerſary be a man of iudgement and valour, and you be the firſt in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, you bring your lyfe in ieopardye: for either of you being within diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce obſeruing time, the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer is in danger to be ſlain or wounded in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, eſpecially if he thruſt reſolutelye: but if you <pb facs="tcp:11283:36"/> be skilfull and not the other, then may you gain time and meaſure, and ſo hit him, ſauing your ſelfe, &amp; then the more furiouſlie your enemie commeth on, the more he runneth headlong vpon his owne danger. Some are of opinion that they can hit him that ſhall hit them firſt, but ſuch as haue neuer fought: or if by chance in one fight they haue beene ſo fortunate, let them not thinke that Summer is come becauſe one ſwallow is ſeene. Mee thinketh more commendable for a man to defend himſelfe, and not offend his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, than to hurt his enemie and bee wounded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for when you ſhall perceiue the danger that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth by euery aſſault without time and meaſure, you wil change your opinion: and ſome others there are that hold it a ſhame for a man to retire.</p>

                        <p>I am glad to heare you of that opinion, for wee ſee the like in martiall policye, where oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traites are made of purpoſe to drawe the enemye ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into ſome imboſcata or place of aduantage, and
<pb facs="tcp:11283:37"/> ſuch as are moſt inſolent and preſumptuous, are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt drawne into thoſe plots, who runne headlong on their death like beaſtes. In like ſorte, hee that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the true vſe of his weapons, will ſuffer his aduerſarye in his raſhnes, vntill he finde time and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ſafely to annoy him. And ſithens I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſpeake of combates, I wil recite one other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed in Piemont, in the time of Charles the 5. betweene two Italians, and two Spaniards, as I haue heard it deliuered by diuers Gentlemen preſent at the action. A Spaniſh Captaine, more braue in ſhew then valorous in deede, to inſinuate himſelfe with the Emperour, began in ſcornfull ſorte to finde fault with other nations, and among the reſt, with Italians, where the Spaniard had neuer had foote of ground, if the Italians themſelues had not beene made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their owne conqueſte: but to let that paſſe, this Spaniard hauing in woords diſgraced the Italian nation, it came to the Italians eares, whereupon two Italians, the one of Padua, and the other of Vicenza, wrote a cartell vnto the Spaniard, which was carried by him of Vicenza, who finding the Spaniard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with diuers Gentlemen, deliuered him the cartell, which he receiued, ſaying that hee would go to his Chamber and read it, whereunto the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centine replyed, that he ſhould read it ere hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that it was a cartel. Which the Spaniard ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing read in preſence of the whole companye, asked the Vicentine whether he or his fellow would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the cartell, to whome the Vicentine anſwered, that the woords repeated in the cartell was a lye, and <pb facs="tcp:11283:37"/> that hee was preſent to auouch it: wherewithall hee offered to draw foorth his ſworde, and ſo the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and his companion accepted the combat againſt the two Italians, of which matter the Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aduertiſement, conceiued diſpleaſure againſt the preſumption of the Spaniard, and ſo, place of combate was prepared in preſence of many great perſonages: the combatters being entered the liſtes, one of the Italians (who were both in their ſhirts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) rent of the lefte ſleeue of his ſhirt, which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard beholding, ſaide hee needed not take ſo muche paine, for he meant to haue cut of his arm ſleeue and all: to whom the Padouan replyed, that he meant to haue cut of the Spaniards head firſte, and therefore prepared his arme for the purpoſe, wherwithall they encountred all very furiouſlye, ſo that the Vicentine was firſt wounded, who crying out to his fellow that he was hurt, the Padouan comforted him with hope of better ſucceſſe to come, and began warely to keep his garde, but the Spaniards preſuming on the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, charged them ſo much the harder without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, till at length the Padouan finding his time, with a reſolute ſtoccata ranne the one through the bodie, and with a ſodaine riuerſa, cut the others neck almoſt quite in ſunder, and ſo they were both ſlaine together: I haue induced theſe examples for two cauſes, the one, for that many contemne this art, and make no account therof, and the other becauſe there are ſome ſo inſolent, as they ſeek nothing but to ſowe diſcenſion between frendes and allies, which if they were reſtrained, it might ſaue the liues of many men: <pb facs="tcp:11283:38"/> for as wee ſee in the laſt example, there wanted not much to haue cauſed a generall mutiny between the Spaniard &amp; the Italian, through the inſolencie of the Spaniard, if the Emperour had not drawne the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a ſhorter triall, by forbidding any one to offer the firſt blow amongſt them, vpon paine of death: pronouncing the Italians victors, that had acquited themſelues in ſo honourable ſorte. Therefore you may ſee how dangerous the company of theſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome perſons is, who doe leſſe harme with their ſwordes then with their tungs: for as the Italian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is, <hi>La lingua non ha oſſo, ma fa rompere il doſſo,</hi> that is, the tung hath no bones, and yet it breaketh the backe: ill tunges are occaſions of much debate. But to returne from whence I haue digreſſed, you muſt neuer be too raſh in fight, account of your enemye, yet feare him not, and ſeeke all meanes to become victor, and ſo you ſhall maintaine your reputation, and not endanger your ſelfe in vnaduiſed haſtines.</p>

But ſhew me I beſeech you, how I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue my ſelfe when I am to fight, you haue alreadye taught mee the time, meaſure, and motion of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and now I would learne ſomething of reſolution.</p>

                        <p>Hauing taken weapons in hand, you muſt ſhewe boldnes and reſolution againſt your enimy, and be ſure to put your ſelfe well in gard, ſeeking the aduantage of your enemie, and leape not vp and downe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in charging your enemie you goe not leaping, if you be farre off, but when you approch, gard your ſelfe well, for euerie little diſorder giueth aduantage to your aduerſarie, therefore learne to knowe aduantages, and thruſt not at your enemie vntill you bee ſure to hit, and when you haue giuen meaſure, note when it is time to thruſt: then finding your enemie out of garde, make a ſtoccata reſolutely, or elſe not at all: for although you be in time and meaſure, and yet your enemie bee well garded, he may verie eaſily hurt you though his skill be but ſmall. As may be ſeene in many, which altogether ignorant in the vſe of weapons, will naturally put them ſelues in ſome gard, ſo that if one looke not well about him, he ſhal be much endangered by ſuch a one, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth what he doth, but by reaſon that not foreſeeing the danger, hee followeth his purpoſe wyth reſolution, without being able to yeelde a cauſe for that he hath done. Therefore (I ſaie) you muſt ſeeke to gain not meaſure onely, but time and opportunitie as wel to ſaue your ſelfe as anie your enemie, if you will do well, &amp; then if it happen not well vnto you, thinke that God doth puniſh you for your ſinnes: for wee ſee often that at ſome one time a man will doo excellent well, &amp; yet afterward he ſhall ſeeme as though he had neuer taken weapons in hand. And to make it the more apparant: There was a ſouldier in Prouence for his valor in many exploites before ſhewed, generally reputed a verie gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man, who on a time being in a town beſieged, was <pb facs="tcp:11283:39"/> ſo ſuddenlye ſtricken with the terrour of the batterie, and diſmaide therewith, that hee could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from ſeeking ſome caue to hide himſelfe: who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward taking hart agreſſe, came foorth againe, and beeing demaunded of the Captaines where hee had been, who told them the truth of the whole matter, and afterward behaued himſelfe very valiantly.</p>
                        <p>In like ſorte Marco Querini a gentleman of Venice, Captaine of the Gallies belonging to the ſignorye of Venice, in the ſea Adriaticum, liuing delicatelye in all careleſſenes, ſuffered the Turkes to run ouer the gulfe, ſpoyling and robbing at their pleaſure, not daring to make reſiſtance, which the Generall of the Signory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, repaired thither with all expedition, thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Querini Captaine of the gulfe, if hee perfourmed his office no better, the whole ſhipping ſhould bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, &amp; he ſent home to Venice on foot. The ſhame whereof moued him ſo farre, that afterward hee became famous for his exploites.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer in the time of the Venecians warres with the Turke, the Generall of the Turkiſh forces beeing come into the Sea Adriaticke, neere vnto Schiauonia, Allibaſſa &amp; Carracoſſa, who afterward died in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of Pautou, would needs inuade the Iſle Curſolla with ſome forces, and batter a towne there, where the men diſmaied with the ſoddainnes of the attempt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelues to flight, and left the place to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the women, who quitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with ſuch vndaunted courage, that one of them betaking her ſelf to a peece of artillerie, plaied the gunner ſo artificiallie, that ſhe directed a ſhot cleane through the ſhip where Allibaſſa was, much ſpoyling the ſame, which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, preſently commaunded the ancker to be wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:11283:39"/> and hoiſing vp ſailes, retired all his forces, by which meanes the women ſaued the cittie: ſo that heerin we ſee the difference of mens diſpoſitions in courage at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times, and yet I commend it not in any man to want valour at any time. But to come to the purpoſe, albeit one be not ſo well diſpoſed to the managing of weapons at one time, as at ſome other, yet hauing the practiſe and vnderſtanding thereof, he ſhall euer be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to maintaine his parte.</p>

If your enemie carrie his ſword ſhort, in an open ward, you maie come ſtraight on him and giue him a punta riuerſa either in the belly or face, with ſuch readines, that your ſword be halfe within his dagger before hee can breake it, turning nimblye your hand toward your left ſide, ſo that in offering to breake he ſhall make himſelfe be hit either in the face or in the belly: and forget not to retire an halfe pace with the right foot, accompanied with the left.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if your enimie lie with his ſword alofte, and the point downwards, you maie charge him foure waies, firſt on the right ſide, cloſing your weapons in a lowe gard, and your right foot within the right foot of your enimie toward his left ſide, and then being within
<pb facs="tcp:11283:40"/> diſtance, giue him a ſtoccata, ſudenly drawing home your point againe, or you may play with your bodie, but hold your dagger firm, marking (as it were) with one eye the motion of your aduerſarie, and with the other the aduantage of thruſting.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, you may make a ſtoccata to his bellye, not reſolutely, but to cauſe him to anſwere you, and then you muſt playe with your bodye toward your lefte ſide, and bearing the thruſt on your right ſide, paſſe a little on his right ſide, and make a riuerſa a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his ſworde.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, you may come vpon his point with your dagger, cloſing well your weapons, and then beating away his point with your dagger, in the ſame inſtant put a ſtoccata either to his face or bellye, but in anye caſe ſtirre not your dagger arme, leaſt hee falſifie and giue you an imbroccata aboue the dagger: therefore remember to beare your arme ſtraite, and only your wriſt higher or lower.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, you may charge him on the right ſide in the ſame warde, but contrariwiſe, for where before you bent your body on the right ſide, you muſt now turne on the left, ſo that his pointe may ſtill be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your body, and hold your dagger at length, then being within meaſure, you may ſuddenly paſſe with your left foot, carrying the point of your dagger vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and turne your point vnder his Rapier, that it goe directly to his belly, in manner of an imbrocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, in doing whereof you muſt turne your body well, lifting vp your ſworde hand, and with your Rapier and Dagger, aſſure your ſelfe of his, otherwiſe your
<pb facs="tcp:11283:41"/> weapons lying open, if your enemye bee skilfull, and know how to turn his hand, hee might hit you either in the bellye or face with a riuerſa, or cut you on the head, for euery diſorder endangereth a mans life.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if your enemy carry his ſword low, charge him directly, turning your body on the right ſide, with your dagger at length, the pointe hanging ſomething toward the ground, and then as you finde his dagger, ſo make your thruſt: if high, to his belly, if lowe, to his face: if his head be aboue, put a ſtoccata to his face by a trauerſa (as it were) vnder his dagger, and forget not to retire withall with your right foot: and if hee hold out his ſword with the the pointe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when you are toward his right ſide, you ſhall put your ſelf in the ward aforeſaid, bending your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on your lefte ſide, and ſo gaining ground, make a ſtoccata vnder his ſworde, ſo that your dagger be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his rapier, and keepe it without your bodye from your left ſide, and your point in his belly: and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alwaies that in taking your enemies pointe, you ſtir not your dagger arme, becauſe hee may then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger you, as I haue before ſaid. Moreouer, if your enemie put himſelfe in the ſame gard, with his rapier at length, and you in your gard with your right foot formoſt and your point held ſhort, ſo that your right foot be oppoſite to his, you ſhall little and little ſteale ground with your right foote, and followe with the left, till you are within diſtance, and then with agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thruſt either to his belly or face: and this is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing if it bee well vnderſtoode, for beſide the knowledg it requireth practiſe, that you learne not to approche neerer to your enemy then you may ſaue <pb facs="tcp:11283:41"/> your ſelf: otherwiſe you may charge him on the right ſide, bending your body to the left ſide, and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten the aduantage, you muſt ſuddenly paſſe with your left foote, turning withall your pointe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſworde, that it aſcend to his bellye, and clap your dagger as neere as you can to the hiltes of his ſwoorde, all which together with the motion of the body, muſt be done at one inſtant. I ſhall not need to diſcourſe much of your enemies holding of his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but as your enemy carrieth it, either high or low, ſo (I ſay) you muſt with diſcretion thruſt either to his face or belly: but you muſt bee verye well exerciſed in theſe paſſataes, for perfourming them with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the bodye, albeit you happen to faile of your purpoſe, yet your enemie ſhalbe able to take no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage therof, but you ſhalbe ready to anoy him ſtil either aboue or beneath, wherein you muſt followe him in mouing his body: ſo ſhall you ſtil holde your aduantage, and hit him where you will, &amp; if he thruſt again, you ſhall break toward your right ſide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with a riuerſa to the face. Againe if your enemie beare his rapier long and ſtraight, you may charge him, and beating away his ſworde with your owne, ſudenly turn in your point to his face or belly, which is a verie good thruſt, being done with great agilitie,</p>
                        <p>If you perceiue your enemies rapier farre out, &amp; that he go about to falſifie vpon you either aboue or vnderneath your dagger, then put your ſelfe in your ward, with your weapons cloſe together, and as low as you may, holding firme your dagger hande, and whatſoeuer falſifieng he maketh, neuer moue awaie your Dagger hande, neither lifte it high or lowe
<pb facs="tcp:11283:42"/> to get your enemies Rapier, and if you lye belowe in the ward when he falſifieth, remaine ſo without ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any higher, (for otherwiſe hee might at that time finde fit opportunitie to hit you, if he be skilfull in wepons) but follow him cloſe, for if he once thruſt reſolutely, be it aboue or beneath, he muſt needs loſe his whole Rapier, and you may eaſily hit him: and in your thruſting ſtand firme with your body and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Alſo if he holde his dagger ſtraight vpward, and that the point of his rapier be at the hiltes of his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as you ſhall finde occaſion, ſo doe, that is, if his dagger hand be high, thruſt a ſtoccata to him vnder his dagger: if lowe, make a ſtoccata to his face, either cloſe by the hand, or by the middeſt of his arme, and and if you will thruſt as you are in your warde you may, or elſe with retiring. Moreouer, if your enemie turne his dagger point toward his right ſide, charge him on that ſide, with a punta riuerſa to his face, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in your warde, or retiring as you pleaſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if he lying in that warde, carry his point out of the warde of your dagger any whit a little too high, charge him cloſe, and holding forth your Dagger, you may ſuddenly take his point with your Dagger, or if you will you may by remouing the right foote a little forward, giue him a ſtoccata, but keepe ſtedfaſt your dagger hand, as I taught you before, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he make an imbroccata to your face. Againe, if he carrye his point any whit too much toward your right ſide, turn your body on your left ſide, in a good ward, charging him on the right ſide, and bring your right foote cleane without his right foot, and hauing ſo doone, thruſt your rapier vnder his about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, <pb facs="tcp:11283:42"/> and ſo make a paſſata vpon him, or you may charge with a riuerſa to his throte, or ſuch like, either abiding in your warde, or ſuddenlye ſcaping away with your body. If you perceiue he holde his rapier farre out, and not turned, charge him below, turning your body on the right ſide, and turne your dagger point ſomewhat lowe vpon your enemies point, and hauing gotten this aduantage, being within meaſure, thruſt either to his bellye or face, as you ſhall beſt ſee cauſe.</p>

                        <p>If your enemie charge you, and haue gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie aduantage of you either with his foot, or turning of the bodie, or rapier, or dagger, or by what meanes ſoeuer, ſeeke to put your ſelfe in a ſure warde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire a little, keeping your ſelfe ſtill in gard, leaſt elſe by retiring, if you moue vp your bodie or dagger, your enemy might by dexteritie and quicknes offend you greatly: but whileſt hee chargeth you, couet to turne your bodie to one ſide or other, as you find the point of your enemies rapier, and euen at that inſtant that he moueth his foot in charging you, as you finde him open in any place, ſo ſeeke to offend him, and beware (as I ſayd before) in what ſort you retire, for ſomtime there is a fit time, when you thruſt to retire, and ſome times not, therefore take diligent heed thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, when he hath gotten aduantage, being <pb facs="tcp:11283:43"/> in his ward, if he wold thruſt a ſtoccata to you vnder your dagger, you ſhall be nimble to auoide it by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your daggers point downward, &amp; you ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him with a ſtoccata, or imbrocata, or punta ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa, as you ſhall finde opportunitie: but if he make an imbrocata aboue your dagger, you may auoide it by lifting vp a little the point of your dagger, and by turning the wriſt of your hand to the left ſide, for that his imbrocata ſhall go cleane without your left ſide, &amp; you may make a thruſt to him, as you ſhall finde him open in anie place. Againe, if hee make an imbrocata to your bodie, you may giue backe a little with your bodie, and beat it awaie with your right ſide, &amp; may make to him a punta riuerſa to his bodie or face: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if he be towards your right ſide, &amp; thruſt at your face, you may yet beat it awaie, &amp; anſwere him with a punta riuerſa or a paſſata. Againe, if he make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocata aboue your dagger, beware that your rapiers point be within his, and make vnto him a meza-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carta, turning the pointe either to the belly, face, or throate: but you muſt with greate agilitie turne your point &amp; bodie on your right ſide. Againe, if he make a blow to your head, at the inſtant that he moueth his hand make you ſodainly a ſtoccata vnto him, and (if you be in a good ward) you may make a punta riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa to his thigh, but if he make a blow to your leg, ſtand faſt in your warde with your bodie farre out, and in his thruſting come forwarde with your right foote, whereby you ſhal cauſe him to leeſe the greateſt part of his rapier, and turne your dagger point low, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the blow on the ſame, and you may make vnto him either a ſtoccata to the face, or a riuerſa to his <pb facs="tcp:11283:43"/> necke or arme. Again, when he thruſteth to your leg, remoue your right foote to your right ſide, as it were making a circle, &amp; ſo offend your enimy: as if he make a riuerſa to the head, you may take it vpon your rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; dagger, paſſing with your left foot, turning your rapier hand &amp; making a ſtoccata: and if you will you may by paſsing receiue the riuerſa vpon your dagger onely, but looke you carrie your dagger point aloft, as I haue told you before. Againe, if hee make the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa to your leg, you may ſodeinly paſſe with your left foot to his right, &amp; take the riuerſa on your dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for thereby you get the ſtrength of his rapier, and are maſter of it, and may eaſily ſtrike him. Again, if he make anie violent blow at your head, retire a litle on your lefte ſide, &amp; receiue it with your rapiers point, paſsing with your left foote, &amp; turning your point to his face, &amp; clapping your dagger on his rapier: all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blowes and riuerſaes you may eaſily receiue on your dagger, but it behoueth you to receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the point of your rapier, otherwiſe your enemie might thruſt his rapier between your rapier &amp; dagger eſpecially if he caſt his hande vpward, and his pointe downward, therefore take heed how you thruſt, for theſe are all good times. If your enemie come furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie vpon you to aſſault you, keep you ſtill in your gard, and in his comming neere to you, thruſt at him, for he is neither in ward nor yet ſtandeth firme, and the more reſolutely he commeth vpon you, the more he is in danger, and the woorſe is it for him, becauſe hee may eaſily with a little pricke bee ſlaine: but cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ioyned with skill and knowledge is verie good.</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:44"/>Againe, if a tall man ſhould aſſault a little man, this ward is exceeding good for the tal man, becauſe if he charge the other, &amp; the tall man thruſt, being within rech, he loſeth his point, &amp; the litle man may giue him a ſtoccata, or make a paſſata at him, but if the tall man know how to put himſelf in ward &amp; thruſt, he might haue great aduauntage by the length of his reach, in thruſting a ſtoccata, and retiring with his bodie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if your enemie woulde make a paſſata on you with his left foote, when you finde him to remoue, &amp; woulde beate your weapons awaie with his dagger, moue your right foote a little backward, and ſodein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne your point ouer his dagger, and make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocata to him, for in his paſsing he looſeth his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and whileſt he paſſeth, you may retire a little into your ward, and make a ſtoccata to his face, and ſuche like, whereof I cannot now ſtand to write.</p>

All which you muſt do with great celeritie and quickneſſe, turning your bodie with great nimbleneſſe on your left ſide, and recoiling ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with your left foote, being accompanied with the right, and ſo you ſhal deliuer your ſelfe and your rapier
<pb facs="tcp:11283:47"/> withall out of the power of your enemie, but if you bee not paſsing readie with your foot, and in turning your bodie wel and fitly on your right ſide, your enemie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering maye thruſt you in the bellie with his Rapier, and giue you a ſtabbe with his Dagger beſides. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aduertiſe you to exerciſe your ſelfe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that occaſion beeing offered you to fight, you maie perfourme the ſame with much readineſſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger, otherwiſe, if you onely faile in one and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the leaſt point, you endanger your life.

                        <p>Againe to the purpoſe: If your enemie make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes your right ſide, and offer a thruſt, happilie preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing too much forward, you ſhall immediatlie turne your bodie on the left ſide ſo that the point of his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier paſſing beſide your bodie, you maye giue him a ſtoccata: or you may plaie with your bodie, and beate his Rapier pointe outward from your right ſide wyth your Dagger, and giue him a punta riuerſa ouer his Rapier in the belly or face. Or alſo while hee thruſteth, you may beate it by with your Dagger, and carrying your right foote towarde his right ſide, giue him the ſame thruſt. Or againe, whileſt hee doeth thruſt, you maye ſtande firmelie, turning your bodie a little vpon your lefte ſide, and ſtrike by his Rapier pointe with <pb facs="tcp:11283:47"/> your Dagger, and therewithall giue him a riuerſa vpon the legge. And if hee bee skilfull in managing his weapon, take heede in anie caſe that you let him not get within you, or winne grounde of you, but ſeeke ſtill to growe vppon him with your foote, that is, that your right foote bee without ſide of his right foote, and when hee giues the foreſaide thruſt, take heed you ſtrike neither with your Rapier nor Dagger, if you meane to enter vpon him with a paſſata, becauſe hee hauing once gained of you both opportunitie of time and meaſure of grounde, you endaunger your ſelfe verie much: but you ſhall onelye turne your Rapier hande inwarde, paſsing ſpeedelie with your lefte foot to his right foote, placing the middeſt of your right foote iuſt at the heele of your lefte foote, holding your bodie on the left ſide.</p>
                        <p>As for your Dagger, that muſt bee helde vp with the pointe alofte, to the ende that it maie bee maſter of his Rapier: and ſo ſhall hurte him either vnder or aboue his Dagger. But you muſt beware and take greate heede, not to paſſe directlie right vppon him, when you make your paſſata with your lefte foote to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde his right foote, for if that he bee anie thing skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hee maie giue you a ſtoccata, or imbroccata. Wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you make towards him, ſee you throw your ſelfe wholie on the lefte ſide, accompanying your left foot with your right, in the manner aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if you perceiue your enemies Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier pointe to bee borne towardes your right ſide, hauing gotten vppon him with your right foote, paſſe with your lefte foote verie ſpeedilie and quicklie to his right foote, and carrying your Dagger, as <pb facs="tcp:11283:48"/> in the manner aforeſaid, and giue him an imbroccata vpon his Rapier. But if you finde his Rapier point born vpon your bodie, you ſhall turne your bodie on your lefte ſide, and with great celeritie drawe your point vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Rapier, that the point therof be vpon his bellie, and your left foote by the right, your dagger being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with the point vpward, to command his rapier, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your bodie on your right ſide.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if you perceiue his Rapier to be long, and the point thereof borne ſomewhat high, you ſhall neuertheleſſe anſwere him in this ward: now not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Rapier hand on the inſide of your knee, but carrying your dagger ſtraight out, and winding your bodie on your lefte ſide, you ſhall make ſemblaunce to beate by his weapon with your dagger, and with great quickneſſe you ſhall draw the point of your dagger vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Rapier, readily turning your bodie vppon your right ſide, and carrying your right foote together with your left ſomewhat towards his lefte ſide, &amp;c. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how you vſe this paſſata, vnleſſe you bee well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in it, and ſee you holde ſtiffe your dagger hande, for if you ſuffer your hand to ſwarue anie thing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, your enemie maie giue you an imbroccata in the face.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, in your paſſata lift not your dagger too high, becauſe (if he bee skilfull with whome you fight) whileſt you lifte vp your dagger, or holde your Rapier and Dagger too open, and not inough cloſed, hee maie retire a little, and ſo giue you a ſtoccata or imbroccata, inſomuch that you muſt haue an eſpeciall care of all, or or elſe you cannot auoide daunger of death. Againe, when you make this paſſata, ſee that you remaine not <pb facs="tcp:11283:48"/> with your lefte foote, hecauſe he may giue you a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dritta vppon the legge, or elſe a ſtoccata in the bellie. Alſo in the ſame paſſata, ſee that your bodie reſt not wholie vppon your lefte ſide, becauſe that ſo dooing, you ſhall your ſelfe beare your enemies Rapier pointe vpon your face.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this, when you lie in this warde, and make vppon your enemie towardes his right ſide, if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that hee holde his Rapier hande ſomewhat high and farre off from his bodie, followe you well in this warde, and getting ſufficient grounde of him, you maie giue him a ſtoccata in the bellie: and in giuing it, ſee that the pointe of your Rapier enter vnder the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his, being your ſelfe readie to winde awaie with your bodie.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in charging him, if you finde that his pointe bee carried to the ground-ward, turne ſteadfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon your lefte ſide, and holde your dagger out in length towards his right ſide: and if you can beate the middeſt of his Rapier with your Dagger, at the ſame inſtant giue him a ſtoccata. You maie alſo in the ſame warde make a paſſata with your lefte foote. But if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes your enemie when you lie in this warde, ſhould make ſemblaunce to thruſt you, not meaning ſo to do, but onelie for vauntage, ſo you bee in equall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, anſwere him, and looſe not that time: but if you be not in equall reach, thruſt not earneſtly, nor make a paſſata vppon him, for ſo you ſhoulde endaunger your lyfe: but in aunſwering him make but a ſhort thruſt at him, to the ende that if your enemie or aduerſarie afterwarde make a true thruſt, or elſe come forwarde <pb facs="tcp:11283:49"/> with his lefte foote, to make a paſſata vppon you, you maie ſodainly turne your bodie on your lefte ſide, and place your Dagger-hand right with your right knee. And ſo you maie giue him a ſtoccata in the bellie, or elſe a riuerſa vpon the legge, and become maiſter of his weapon: and by howe much the more ſtrongly hee thruſteth, and the more furiouſlie hee entereth with the paſſata, by ſo much the more eaſilie may you hurt him: but haue a great and ſpeciall regarde to doo it with much nimbleneſſe and dexteritie both of bodie and hand.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if you finde his Rapier long, in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him you maie ſtrike the middle of his Rapier with yours, and ſodainely giue him the punta riuerſa: but it muſt be done with great quickneſſe of the hand, beeing readie with your right foote to ſteppe towardes your enemies right ſide, or elſe to recoile ſomewhat with your bodie backwardes as ſwifly as you canne: for elſe if your enemie at that inſtant ſhoulde enter with a paſſata ſomething fiercelye, your lyfe were in greate hazarde, and eſpeciallye if you ſhoulde make your thruſt ſtraight, carrying your foote right towards his, as manie doo: but if you ſteppe with your right foote aſide, you maie verie eaſilye auoide the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>Againe, if you finde his Rapier point out at length, you maie ſtrike his Rapier with yours, and giue him a greate mandritta or riuerſa at the head, but with greate ſwifteneſſe of hand and bodie. Alſo lying in the ſame warde towardes the right ſide of your enemie, you
<pb facs="tcp:11283:49"/> may giue a falſe ſtoccata at his bellie, and if your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doo happe to ſtrike it backe with his Rapier, you ſhall ſodainely put the pointe of your Rapier ouer his, and giue him a ſtoccata or punta riuerſa vpon his face, or his bellie, if hee ſhoulde too much hang downe his hand, at which time you muſt beare your right foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide towardes his right ſide. You maie alſo offer a falſe thruſt at his face, and if hee go about to ſtrike it by with his Rapier, you maie put your pointe vnder his Rapier, and carrying your right foote ſide-waie, giue him a ſtoccata in the bellie: or in both theſe falſe thruſts, when he beateth them by with his rapier, you may with much ſodainneſſe make a paſſata with your lefte foote, and your Dagger commaunding his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, you maie giue him a punta, either dritta, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if your enemie finding you with your Rapier point borne out in length, ſhould ſtrike by your rapier with his, in the verie inſtant that he ſtriketh, you maie paſſe with your right foote towards his rightſide, and with great quicknes putting your Rapier ouer his, giue him a punta riuerſa in the face, and if hee bee not verie skilfull at his weapon, you may ſodainly make a paſſata vpon him, and this maie happen vnto you verie often: but you ought to bee well exerciſed in theſe pointes, which may make you verie nimble and quicke with your foot, body, and hand, leaſt for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and practiſe in this facultie, you fal not into ſome inconuenience and diſhonour, for in the verie leaſt point conſiſteth life and death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:50"/>Therefore neglect not theſe thinges, but rather take pains and trauaile in the knowledge of them, honoring and eſteeming them both excellent and profitable: neither haue I entered into this charge, to diſcourſe and explaine theſe pointes for their ſakes that hate valour and knowledge, for vnto ſuch doo I not directe my ſpeech, but vnto thoſe that loue, regarde, and honour venue: who beeing worthie of this knowledge, may alwaies commaund my ſeruice.</p>
                        <p>But to returne to our purpoſe: if your enemie find you in this ſayde warde, holding your bodie towardes your lefte ſide, and towardes his right ſide, and giue you a mandritta at the head, you ſhall ſpeedilye and with greate agility turne your bodie on your right ſide, and receiuing his mandritta vppon your Dagger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne him a ſtoccata either in the bellie or in the face. Likewiſe, if hee giue you an imbroccata ouer the Dagger, you ſhall (turning your bodie vppon your right ſide) aunſwere him with a ſtoccata. But if hee when you lie in this warde, giue you a riuerſa at the heade, you may immediatlye make a paſſata with the lefte foote, and ſo preſentlye requite him with a ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata.</p>
                        <p>If you thinke it not conuenient, and therefore will not paſſe with your lefte foote at the ſame inſtaunce that hee giueth the riuerſa, you ſhall turne your bodie on your lefte ſide, and ſo haue your choice eyther to giue him a ſtoccata in the bellie, or a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa at the legges: and if you bee thoroughly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and practiſed in charging, you maye giue him a dritta or a riuerſa at his legges, being the firſt to ſtrike.</p>

                        <p>I Know not certainly, whether it hath been my earneſt deſire to encounter you, that raiſde me earlier this morning than my accuſtomed houre, or to be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of ſome doubtfull queſtions, which yeſter-night were propoſed by ſome gentlemen and my ſelfe, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <pb facs="tcp:11283:51"/> of armes: for they helde, that although a man learne perfectly the dritta, riuerſa, the ſtoccata, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broccata, the punta riuerſa, with eche ſeuerall motion of the body, yet when they hap to come to ſingle fight, where the triall of true valour muſt ende the quarrell, they vtterly forget all their former practiſes. Therefore would I requeſt of you, (if you ſo pleaſe) to know your opinion, whether in ſingle fight a man can forget his vſuall wardes, or vſe them then with as much dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and courage as he accuſtomed in play.</p>

                        <p>It is very likely, that many are of this opinion, for there are fewe or none that in cauſe of quarrell when they come as we tearme it to buckling, but ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ouercome with fury, and ſo neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber their arte: ſuch effect choller worketh. And it may be ſome being timerous and full of puſillanimity, (which is euer father to feare) are ſo ſcarred out of their wits, that they ſeeme men amazed and voide of ſence. Or ſome may be taken in the humor of drinke, or with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other occaſions, that may enfeeble their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And by theſe reaſons well may they forget in fight, what they learned in play: but in them in whome no ſuch effectes are predominant, neither are aſſailed with ſuch accidentes, they behaue themſelues diſcreetely, and are not diſtempered with any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations: and beſides this, I haue ſeen many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fearfull by nature, through dayly practiſe haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come couragious, and alwaies ſo continued.

                        <p>To this I anſwere, that this vertue or art of armes is proper and behouefull to euerye one for their liues, becauſe that no man on earth, but hath had or hath in preſence ſome difference or contention with ſome of his companions, which moſt commonly is decided by fight. To them that are of an hautie courage, this skill addeth aduantage: to them whoſe nature is fearful, the vſe of weapons extenuateth a great parte of feare: and theſe, both the one and other, ought as much as in them lyeth, to auoide all cauilling, and ſuch diſordered ſpeeches as procure contention: but eſpeciallye, let ſuch men take heede, to whome nature hath not giuen a valorous ſpirite: as for others, whoſe courage is hot, it importes them very much, to haue great skill in their weapon, for being ouer-maſtered with heate and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of their harts, if in managing their armes they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a skilfull dexteritie, they ſoone ſpoyle themſelues: for through wante of knowledge, they come to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, where rather it behoueth them with aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcretion, not onely to ſpy their own faults, and ſoone to amend them, but alſo thorough his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ouer-ſights, to take his owne aduantage.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11283:53"/> lefte ſide, in manner of an halfe wheele: but it behoues you to be verye readye, otherwiſe, in ſtaying in your paſſage, if hee auoyde in that counter-time, hee maye put you in danger of life: the like is, if you paſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlye, you are both of you in danger of death: or if you ſhould paſſe directlye, and hee keepe himſelfe in ſafe warde, or that he auoide in compaſſe, he may well ſaue him ſelfe and endanger you. Therefore finding your enemie in this warde, euer obſerue to carrie your ſelfe in compaſſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if you aſſaile your enemie with this warde, and hee lye with his right foote formoſt, if hee holde his Rapier far from him, you may directlye take his pointe, keeping your dagger long out, and your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die lowe: and if he thruſt either aboue or belowe, keep your Dagger ready to break his thruſt, and offer home to him vpon the lefte foote, or paſſe towards him with your rightfoote, as you ſhall finde beſt. And in your caricado ſee if you can commaund his ſwoorde with your Dagger, either from your lefte or right ſide, and then thruſt your ſtocceta or punta riuerſa. If you ſee him lye diſplaied, followe him, bearing your Dagger within his ſword, and you maie well thruſt your ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata either at his face or breſt: or elſe make a paſſata re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie, wheeling halfe about, keeping your ſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie in a good warde, vpon your rightfoote.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, in this warde you maye eaſilie giue him a mandritta or riuerſa vpon his legge, or you maie vſe a caricado vpon his right ſide, keeping your warde, and carrying well your bodye, that the halfe of your right foote garde your lefte heele, and guiding <pb facs="tcp:11283:54"/> your body directly vpon your left ſide, make forwarde directly vpon his right foot, thereby to commaund his ſwoorde, and then may you ſtrike him vpon the lefte foote. Againe, if you ſee hee keepes his Dagger pointe vpon you, thruſt a ſtoccata at his face: if you finde him not well commanding his point, charge him vpon his right ſide, bearing the dagger long, and break his thruſt outwards, offring your ſtoccata at his face or breſt. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if you ſee he commaund not his point, and being aduantaged vpon his right ſide, you maye with great readines put your pointe vnder his ſwoord, lifting your ſwoord hand and your dagger, when in the mean time you may giue him a ſtoccata or imbroccata, and be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his ſwoorde with yours and your Dagger. And in charging him vpon his right ſide, you may giue him a riuerſa vpon his legge.</p>
                        <p>Againe, if hee offer a mandritta at your head, in the lifting of his hand aduance your ſelfe with your right foote, and receiue it vpon your Dagger, giuing him a ſtoccata at his breſt or face: ſo if hee thruſt a riuerſa at your head, you ſhal lift vp the point of your Dagger, &amp; receiue it on your dagger &amp; ſworde, &amp; in the ſame time thruſt an imbroccata at his belly, or elſe taking the riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa vpon your Dagger, you ſhall giue him another vpon the legges, or a ſtoccata in the belly. Likewiſe, if your enemie ſhall giue you a mandritta vpon the legge, you ſhall nimbly paſſe circularly with your right foote to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his lefte ſide, for ſo hee cannot offend you, and you may hit him either in the belly or face.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if your enemie thruſt an imbroccata a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue your Dagger, you muſt readilye paſſe with your <pb facs="tcp:11283:54"/> right foote before he retire with his point, and you may well hit him in the face, breaſt, or legges. Again, if when you charge him towardes his right ſide, you ſee his point be farre out and ſomewhat high, keepe your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vppon your lefte ſide, and lie lowe couered in your ward, bearing your dagger at the length of your arme, keeping good meaſure: and in your cariage, make ſhew to put by his Rapier with your dagger, and ſodainly fal your point vnder his ſword, trauerſing with your right foot round, turning your bodie vppon your right ſide, &amp; ſo thruſt your ſtoccata at his face or breaſt. And if he hold his point high, you may charge him directly with his point, for if hee thruſt either aboue or below, in the time of his thruſt aduaunce your left foote, extending your dagger, and by that aduancing hee ſhall looſe his point, and you maie hit him with a dritta or riuerſa at your pleaſure. And if he thruſt at you, and you paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with your right foote, then you maie likewiſe hit him.</p>

                        <p>I haue tolde you many things concerning this ward, if you know how to doo them and practiſe them. Beſides, there bee diuerſe other things which I cannot ſhew you with ſpeaking: but for this time it will bee ſufficient if you can perform what I haue declared. And I will tell you: if you lie with your right foote formoſt, and he keepe his left foote forwarde, according as you marke his lying, ſo do, charging him either on the lefte
<pb facs="tcp:11283:55"/> or right ſide. And although you hit him not; and that he paſſe vpon his right foote, doe you but change your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to your left ſide, lifting vp the point of your poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, firming your hand on your right knee, ſo ſhall you be maſter of his ſword, and maie eaſily ſtrike him, and the more fierce he is, the more ſhall you commaund his weapon and endanger him: neither can hee ſtrike you either within or without your dagger, or on the legges. And if you ſee he keepes his dagger winding towardes his right ſide, thruſt a riuerſa at his face, ſo that your point may enter in the midſt of his dagger, and ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recoile, and if he likewiſe parte, turne your bodie, as I haue tolde you, vpon your left ſide, and as you ſee him lie, ſo guarde your ſelfe, bearing your bodie on which ſide you thinke beſt.</p>
                        <p>And ſurely beleeue mee, the firſt warde I taught you of Rapier and dagger, is abſolutely the beſt both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this and anie other kinde of lyings. Therefore I woulde wiſh you to learne it perfectly, and exerciſe it thoroughly, that if occaſion happen, you may be both skilfull and well practiſed. But take heede of one fault, which many incurre, who if in plaie they receiue one or two ſtoccataes, they inforce themſelues to giue one to be reuenged. But this is neither fit for a ſcholler, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie, ſince in plaie we ſhuld behaue our ſelues friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, both to learn and paſſe the time, and alſo to exerciſe our ſelues in ſtirring our bodies, and vſe this arte for the right effect. Wherein wee ought eſpeciallie to auoide choler and anger. For where occaſion happens to fight, in deede, rapiers are not as foiles, which cannot doo much hurt, but a ſmall pricke of a Rapiers pointe maie either kill, or at the leaſt maime. So that in anie wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide <pb facs="tcp:11283:55"/> ſo daungerous an ouerſight. And if you happe to wound your enemie, though verie ſmallie, yet by the ſight of his blade, hee heeing kindled with furie, ſhall both enfeeble his ſtrength, and fall from his right bias. Therefore I wiſh you take good heede, and if you ſee your ſelfe apte to incline to ſuch a faulte, amende it, and learne perfectlie to defende your ſelfe well, to the end that if perhappes you cannot hurt your enemie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that he ſurpaſſeth in skil, or you want ſtrength, yet you maie auoide danger of beeing hurt your ſelfe, which will bee both honorable and profitable to you, conſidering that euen the verie firſt thruſt is ſufficient to ende the whole controuerſie. Therefore bee heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wiſe, and remember I haue tolde you ſoundly for your owne ſafetie.</p>

                        <p>Sithence I ſee you conceiue ſuch pleaſure in it, I will proceede on and goe forward a little farther. Manie there bee which exerciſe this warde vppon theyr lefte foote, but therein they differ. Therefore it importes to bee well inſtructed in the diuerſitie: for if your enemie lie in that warde, and you vppon your right foote, and hee beare himſelfe and his Dagger highe, charge him towardes his lefte ſide, and in the approche, ſee you parte with greate readyneſſe <pb facs="tcp:11283:56"/> with your right foote towardes his left, and ſpeedilie thruſt you a ſtocata in his belly, &amp; in the thruſting, look you enter vnder his arme or hande, turning your bodie on the right ſide, and the back ſide of your ſword hand toward your left. If he hold his dagger low, charge him towards his left ſide with your right foote ſide-waies, and thruſt either a ſtoccata or imbroccata, as you ſhall thinke beſt, aboue his dagger, and for your owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, turne your bodie vpon the right ſide. And if you ſee him lie diſplaide, carrie your bodie on your right ſide, and trauerſe to his lefte, and then thruſt your ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata betweene his ſword and dagger.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, you maye thruſte your ſtoccata ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his face or breaſt, but doo it with greate promptneſſe, and in the ſame time recoile with your left foot drawing after your right, and be quicke in the retire to recouer your rapier, that if your enemie make forward, you may be readie againe to thruſt: therefore be quicke and vigilant, otherwiſe if in your thruſting you be not readie, in that ſelfe ſame time your enemie maie well hit you: but retiring with your feete, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping with your bodie, you ſhall ſhunne all daunger. Againe, if you finde his rapier point high, charge him lowe vpon the left foot, and directlie with your dagger at his Rapiers point, bearing your Dagger as I haue taught you: ſo you maie thruſt either at his face or breſt without retiring, but being ſure to lie wel in your ward, for in the time whileſt you retire or withdraw your feet, you ſhall be in danger, but keeping that ward ſure, you are without perill, for whether hee thruſt aboue or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, you beeing in that ward are ſafe, and more ready to winde your pointe aboue or belowe his dagger, or <pb facs="tcp:11283:56"/> you maie giue him a mandritta on the legs: neither can he hurt you in his circular or turning, if he ſhould ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coile. Againe, if you ſee him lie vpright, lie you ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but euer keepe your Dagger readie, and you maie feigne a ſtoccata at his face, and whileſt he goeth about to breake it, winde your pointe quicklie vnder his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and wheele with your bodie halfe compaſſe, auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with your right foote ſide-waies, as I haue tolde you. And if hee charge you lowe and lie open, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming directlie on your pointe, giue backe your bodie a little, and thruſt a riuerſa or a ſtoccata like an imbrocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, and readilie remoue with your right foot backward: or if hee lie as manie doe, with his ſword vpon his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger croſſe-wiſe, you may redilie thruſt him in the face, and retire backeward towards his lefte ſide. Againe, in that maner of lying, you maie charge him towardes his right ſide, and thruſt a ſtoccata at his face, betweene his Rapier and Dagger, euer remembring that your ſword paſſe by the middeſt of his Dagger, and giue him a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa in recoiling backward towards his right ſide. And if you fortune not to hitte him, and that he paſſe vpon his right foote, doe you but change your bodie to the lefte ſide, lifting vp your poniard, and holding your hand firmelie on your right knee, ſo ſhal you be maſter of his ſwoorde, and maie eaſilie hit him: and the more fierce he is, the more you ſhall commaund his weapon, and mangle him, neither can he ſtrike you, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or without your Dagger, or with a dritta or riuerſa vpon the legges. Againe, if you ſee him holde his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the point turning to his lefte ſide, thruſt at his face reuerſa, guiding your pointe to enter in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> his dagger, and ſoddenlie recoile: and if he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <pb facs="tcp:11283:57"/> parte, doe as I haue alreadie tolde you, winding your bodie well vpon your lefte ſide: if you finde him lying open, vſe your caricado toward his right ſide, and lye lowe in your warde, carrying your bodie on your lefte ſide, bearing your Dagger out at length, as I haue taught you in the firſt warde: but let your hand beeing directly with your knee, turne with your bodie, and in this manner you maie offer a thruſt: and if hee thruſt firſt, beare your dagger readie to defend your ſelfe, and your rapier to offend him. But in this be very heedful, as I haue often tolde you, neither eleuate nor abaſe your dagger hand, nor beare him ouer the one ſide or the other, for if your enemy haue good skill in his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and withall a readie hand he may eaſilie beare his pointe compaſſe and hurt you: or many times feigne a thruſt to deceiue you. Therefore be alwaies aduiſed to keepe your hand firme, not abaſing or lifting vp your pointe, or turning your wriſt on the one ſide or other: and if he thruſt at you, you maie well readilie both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your ſelfe, and offend him.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if he abaſe his point, lie in your lefte foot warde, and vſe your caricado vpon his right ſide, and if hee thruſt either an imbrocca aboue your Dagger, or a mandritta at your head, remouing his right foot, turne readilie your bodie on your right ſide, lifting vp your Dagger, and turning your wriſte. Againe, if you finde his pointe farre out, charge him in your left foot warde towards his right ſide, and charge him with your Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cloſe to his ſworde, and letting fall your pointe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his, you maie eaſilie thruſt a ſtoccata or imbrocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, but euer keepe firme your Dagger hand, and lift not vp your bodie, and in breaking his thruſt toward his <pb facs="tcp:11283:57"/> left ſide, you maie giue him a riuerſa either in the breſt or on the legs. Beſides this, many more practiſes there be, which with good exerciſe of body, and readines of hand, might eaſilie be effected. But becauſe it groweth ſomewhat late, and our diſcourſe hath laſted ſo long, I will take my leaue of you, retiring my ſelfe to diſpatch ſome buſines before my going home.</p>

                        <p>He ſhal doo quite contrarie vnto him that is right handed, becauſe the right hand, when I offer him a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa at the head, paſſeth with the left foote, and giueth me the imbroccata vnder my rapier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the left hande, <pb facs="tcp:11283:59"/> whileſt I go backe with my right foot, and that I lift my rapier to giue him the riuerſa, he ſwiftly paſſeth with his right foot before his left, and giueth me a ſtoccata, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand from behinde: &amp; ſo in the paſſataes which he ſhall make, ſtanding with his left foote forward, and paſsing with his right foot to ſtrike his enemie, whereas the right hand paſſeth with his left foot when he giueth a ſtoccata to his enemie, the left hand cleane contrarie, in paſsing giues the imbroccata to his enemie: &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the right hand ſhal giue the imbroccata, the left hand quite contrarie ſhall giue the ſtoccata, and that which I ſaie, is for the left handes inſtruction againſt the right. But nowe I will ſpeake no further of this warde, for ſo much as no other thing foloweth but that which I haue tolde you alreadie concerning the firſt warde of the ſingle rapier, and I will declare vnto you the warde of the rapier and dagger, both to inſtruct the lefte handed how to deale againſt the right hand, and how the right hand ought to behaue himſelfe againſt the lefte hande, which ſhall be our next diſcourſe. And for this time I praie you pardon me, hauing occaſion to go a little way hence, to take vp a matter betweene two of my friends, vpon certaine differences happened betweene them, &amp; by and by we will meet againe.

                           <p>When you goe to charge a lefte handed man in your warde, looke firſt in what ward he lyeth, and how hee holdeth his weapons, anſwering him in the ſame <pb facs="tcp:11283:62"/> forme: and touching your demaund, to knowe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſtrike not at the Dagger ſide, I wil tell you: when I finde him in this ward carrying his lefte foot formoſt, if I ſhould make at his Dagger ſide and ſtrike firſte, I put my ſelfe in danger to hurt my ſelf, becauſe in thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting I runne vpon the pointe of my enemie: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at his lefte ſide, I am out of danger of his pointe, whereof making to his Dagger ſide I am in perill: for if you ſtrike firſte and the lefte handed man haue a good Dagger, and be quicke with his ſworde, he will alwaies put you in hazard of an imbroccata: and in truth there are fewe lefte handes which vſe ſtoccataes, but for the moſt parte imbroccataes. Now if he offer you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broccata firſt, being towards his dagger, and you being nimble with your bodie, whileſt hee ſtrikes at you, you ſhall a little bow aſide with your body, and beat by the pointe outwards from your left ſide, and you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye giue him a ſtoccata or an imbroccata: but if you ſtrike, firſt you endanger your ſelf: and if you will ſtrike the firſt, you ſhall go towards his left ſide, to be in more ſafetie, and offering your blowe, ſeeke to be without his pointe, ſtriuing to faſten your ſtoccata at his face, and retire your lefte foot back with great ſwiftnes, your right foot accompanying your left: but finding him in his ward, to beare his ſwoorde out at length, if you be well aduiſed, you ſhall carrie your right foot after your left, and lye in the third ward I taught you concerning the left foot: and regarde wel whileſt you are inwarde vpon the right foot, and if you wil, out of the firſt ward of Rapier and dagger, enter into the third: be ſure that you paſſe not forward with the left foot firſte, for in ſo doing he might giue you a ſtoccata in the belly or face: <pb facs="tcp:11283:62"/> therefore carie your right foot after your left, and in the ſaid ward, charge him towards his left ſide, who lying with his left foot forward, as you do, if you charge him on the left ſide, vnles he be verie ready and perfect at his weapon you ſhal haue great aduantage of him, &amp; make your ſelfe maſter of his weapons, and greatly indanger his life. Neuertheleſſe if he be skilful, and know how to plaie with his bodie, he maie auoide the foreſayd dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and hazard your life, if you bee not the more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, albeit you finde him, as I ſaid before, lying with his left foot forward. Wherefore it is neceſſarie that you vnderſtand and practiſe well yourſelfe, ſeeing the leaſt errour you maie make, may be your great hurt.</p>

                           <p>But ſuppoſe that one be altogether ignorant, and haue not theſe turnings of his bodie in a readineſſe, you tolde mee there was no difference betweene the right hand and the left hand, neither of them hauing aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the other. And now you tell mee, that the right hand, in caſe he lie in the third ward, trauerſing toward the left ſide of his enemy, hath great aduantage of a left hand. I praie you therefore ſhew mee if there be anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ward, wherein the lefte hande may ſo lie, that the right hand ſhall haue no aduantage vpon him.</p>

                           <p>You know how I ſaide there was no aduauntage betweene them, beſides that which vſe and knowledge giueth to either partie, wherefore if the right hande change from the firſt warde into the third, to aſſault the left hand, then the lefte hand ſhall carrie his lefte foote after his right, ſo lying with the right foote fowarde in good ward, and the right hande lie in the third warde, with his lefte foot forward, and ſo ſhall neither the one or the other haue a iote of aduantage, except that which <pb facs="tcp:11283:63"/> he can giue by true obſeruation of time and meaſure, and his better knowledge: ſo that if the lefte hand be well inſtructed, finding his aduerſarie with his right foote forward, and with his owne right foote forward chargd toward the right ſide in good warde, then ſhall he haue the aduantage vpon the right handed, and be able to make him ſelfe maiſter of his enemies armes. But if the right hand bee well knowledged and bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the turnings and windings of the body, and be quick and readie with the rapier and dagger, he maie auoide theſe hazards, and endanger the left han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man. And this is one of the ſpeciall points which either the one or the other can learne. This which I haue tolde you (eſpeciallie if either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue to deale with one that is ignorant) will giue him the aduantage againſt his aduerſarie. Furthermore, if you ſhall lye in the firſt warde with your right foote formoſt, bearing your ſelfe ſomewhat towards the right ſide of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and hee offer a mandritta at your head, be you readie with your dagger bearing the pointe high, and turning your bodie vpon your left ſide, for ſo you ſhall giue him a ſtoccata, or imbroccata, or punta riuerſa, in the belly or face, according as you ſhal finde your beſt aduantage, &amp; your enemie moſt diſcouered: you may alſo ſtanding ſtedfaſt in good warde, giue him a riuerſa at the legges. But if you ſhould offer to auoide it by turning of your bodie, and be not quick therein, your aduerſarie might giue you a mandritta vpon the face or head: for there are many who in auoiding with their bodies, loſe their daggers, and put themſelues in great danger: alſo the eſcape which you make with your bodie vpon the lefte ſide, is clean contrary to that which you vſe againſt the right handed man, becauſe <pb facs="tcp:11283:63"/> that when the right handed maketh a mandritta at your head, you do not raiſe the point of your dagger much, and turne your bodie vpon your right ſide, but dealing with the left handed, you turne your bodie vpon your lefte ſide: alſo when he giueth you a riuerſa, you ſhall turne your bodie vpon the right ſide. Moreouer, if you ſhall haue occaſion to make a mezza incartata, you ſhal do it in a ſorte clean contrarie to that which you make dealing with a right handed man, for you make your mezza incartata to the right handed man, giuing him a ſtoccata, but to the lefte handed by an imbroccata, playing well with your bodie: if you be well skilled in your weapon, exerciſing your ſelfe in the firſt, ſecond, and third wards, you ſhall do many thinges more then I ſpeake of. Likewiſe the left handed, if he practiſe well theſe foreſaid wardes, ſhall be able to defend himſelfe, and to deal againſt any other ward. And for this time I wil not diſcourſe to you any farther, onely I aduiſe you to exerciſe your ſelfe in all theſe points I haue ſet down vnto you, becauſe beſides the knowledge, you ſhall make your practiſe abſolute in ſuch ſorte, that when occaſion ſhall ſerue to ſpeake of ſuch matters, you maie be able to giue a ſufficient reaſon therof, &amp; alſo defend your ſelfe againſt ſuch as will offer you iniurie, for the worlde is nowe ſubiect to many wronges and inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But you ſhal therby make your ſelfe moſt perfect, and know far more in this behalfe then I haue vttered vnto you, for it is not poſsible in this art to expreſſe all by words, which by your own experience and diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of occurrences you ſhall finde. But for this time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, let vs pray to God to defend vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all miſhaps.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I enter into due examination of the firſt original ground and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this kinde of encounter, and with-all conſider the corruption of mans nature tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humors theſe violent trials haue beene often practiſed: I cannot but allowe of the iuſt complaints framed againſt man by Philoſophers, and wiſe men of former times: as that beeing by his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie and knowledgeable to ſearch out and attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the amplitude of the aire, the hidden ſecrets of the earth, and the reuolutions of the heauens: yet is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and masked in the iudgement of him ſelfe, ſo <pb facs="tcp:11283:67"/> retchles in his own affayres, as that he neuer effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidereth of his own proper nature and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſſe endeuoureth to reforme, what by the eye of reaſon hee might finde controllable and blame-worthie in his diſordered affections. For if as euerye man is by nature capable of reaſon and vnderſtanding, ſo he would diſpoſe and order the conueigh of his life, as he might be reported no euil ſpeaker, no lyer, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, no quarreller, no traitor to his freend, or iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to his neighbour: they which haue written of this ſubiect might well haue ſpared their labour, and this rigorous kinde of congreſſe had beene either not knowen at all, or much leſſe practiſed then it is. But ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence it is a thing common in experience, and vſually ſeene, that through want of gouernment in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (who giuing themſelues to the ful current of their diſpoſition, making their wil their God, and their hand their lawe) matters are carried in a contrarye courſe: it is neceſſarye that ſomething be written of this action, euen as muche as ſhall bee conſonant to reaſon and iudgemente, at leaſt to limit and reſtraine the manner of proceeding in quarrels, if not vtterlye to remoue the occaſion of ſo vnneceſſarie ſtrifes and fruitleſſe contentions. Otherwiſe, in ſteede of order, we ſhould followe confuſion, and depriue both our owne actions and all thinges elſe of their due and iuſt endes.</p>
                  <p>The premiſes conſidered, it is no meruayle if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers perſons giuing themſelues wholye to the bent of their owne indiſcretion and wante of iudgement, eſteeme of thinges cleane contrarye to their nature and qualitye. For if a man frame himſelfe to leade <pb facs="tcp:11283:67"/> a ciuill and temperate courſe of life, ſome will ſaie hee is a foole: if hee be not quarrell-ſome, hee is a cowarde: if no gameſter, hee is of baſe education: if no blaſphemer, an hipocrite: if neither whore-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor baude, hee is neither man nor courteous, but altogether ignorant of the rules of humanity and good fellowſhip. A lamentable ſtate is that, where men are ſo miſled by ignorance and ſelfe loue, as thus to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmoothe and colour their vices and imperfections with the names of vertues, and to thinke any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on currant that is doone by them, and authoryſed by their vnreſiſtable ſwaye, and diſtempered ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</p>
                  <p>What is become of the gentilitie and inbredde courteſie of auncient noble Gentlemen? where is the magnanimitye of the honourable Knightes of fore going times, whoſe vertues as they are recorded in hiſtories wherin we read of them, ſo ought to haue beene lefte to their poſteritye, that in them we might ſee the image (now forgotten) of auncient true Nobilitye? But ſince all thinges fall to decaye, it is no meruaile though vertue (I ſpeake with all due reuerence and fauour) bee not found but in few: for ſurelye there be many in whome nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but the bare tytle of nobilitye, in that they be Gentlemen borne: who in their manners wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from their aunceſtors, and make no account either of honour or diſhonour, giuing themſelues to ſuch pleaſures, as their vnbrideled appetite lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them vnto. Neither can I aſcribe any reaſon to this their ſlyding from vertue vnto vice, contrarie to the courſe taken by their honourable aunceſtours,
<pb facs="tcp:11283:68"/> but this, that whereas while their fathers liued, their bringing vp was committed to tutors of good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcretion, their parentes beeing dead, they withdrawe themſelues from their vertuous kinde of life, leauing and reiecting the ſage counſailes of their inſtructors, and cleauing to their owne deuiſes. To whom, if they amend not and take a better courſe, will lighten ſhame and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore by way of aduiſe, I wiſh all men to auoid euill companie, which for the moſt part is the cauſe of great and infinite loſſe, as well of honor and life as of goods and poſſeſsions: and to followe vertue, bearing themſelues with a ſweet and curteous carriage towards euery man, by which courſe they ſhall gaine commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and credite, and ſhall be eſteemed of all men: and auoiding all ſuch occaſions of diſlike as may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, obtaine a good and honorable reputation. Doth not God forbid a priuate man to kill his neighbour? as it is manifeſted in ſacred ſcriptures againſt <hi>Caine,</hi> to whome God ſaide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> his brother cryed from the earth for vengeance againſt him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therby that he abhorreth murder, and wil reuenge it in due time.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, he created vs naked, without anie thing naturally giuen vs, wherwith to offend or hurt: wheras other creatures haue ſome of them hornes, others clawes, others ſtrong and ſharpe teeth, and others poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And thus were we created of almightie God, to to the end we might liue in peace and brotherlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, as the ſonnes of God, and not as the children of the Deuill, who are the inuentours that found out the vſe of weapons, therewith to offend their neighbours, <pb facs="tcp:11283:68"/> and to maintaine the authoritie of their father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: who was a murderer from the beginning, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth pleaſure in the deſtruction of men, raiſing diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between families, cities, prouinces, and kingdoms. Vpon which occaſion, the neceſſary vſe of armes hath gotten ſuch credit in the worlde, as Kings and Princes haue nobilitated ſome with the name of Knights for their excellencie therein: which name is made noble, and that vpon great reaſon, for ſuch men as haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed nobilitie, by conquering kingdomes for their Princes, more reſpecting their honour and countries good, then any other thing, and eſteeming leſſe of life then of death, in regarde of preſeruing that honor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blotted, which belongeth to Knights, ought not in any wiſe to be deſtitute of high reward. In ſo much, that armes being doubled by ſo many valorous men, it were a great ſhame for one of noble of-ſpring, not to be able to ſpeake of armes, and to diſcourſe of the cauſes of Combats, not to know how to diſcerne the nature and qualitie of wordes and accidents which induce men to challenges, not to bee acquainted with the manner of ſending cartels and challenges, and how fitlye to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the ſame: and in a word, not to haue ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in theſe affaires, as to accorde the parties chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging and challenged, bringing them from their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile threates, to louing embracementes: and of quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foes, to become louing freends, al cauſes of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content beeing taken away on either ſide. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherof, hath in theſe times bred great miſcheefe, for many thinke that an iniurie being offred in deed or worde, the matter may not with their credits be taken vp before they haue fought, not regarding if they bee <pb facs="tcp:11283:69"/> iniuried indeed, that they ought firſt to examine what hee is that hath doone it, and vpon what occaſion hee might doe it: if in woorde, what qualitie the perſon is that ſpake iniuriouſly, and whether hee deſerue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer or no. For a man beeing carried away with chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or wine, maye chaunce to vtter that, for which (his fury being paſt) he will be willing to make any ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherfore it were fondly done by him that would fight vpon euery worde. Neither can I be induced to thinke, that there is any iniury (which is not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with villanie) for which with due ſatisfaction, all cauſe of fighting may not be taken away. But if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie be ſuch, that either murder be committed by tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, or rape, or ſuch like villanies, then is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to proceede in reuenging it, as in due place I will more largely declare.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, I thinke it neceſſary to ſet foorth ſome conſiderations of circumſtance belonging to this ſubiect of quarrels, not becauſe I take vpon me to teach or correct any man, (for that belongeth not to me) but onlye by way of aduertiſement, to warne gentlemen to auoide all dangerous occaſions, growing for want of fore-ſight.</p>
                  <p>And firſte conſidering the little vnderſtanding and ſmall diſcretion of manye, with the dayly danger which ſuch men runne into by indiſcretion, it is fitte for a man to conſider his owne eſtate, for if hee bee a Gentleman borne, hee ought euen for that reſpect with great regarde abſtayne from any acte whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, whereby his woorthye calling may be ſtayned, hee ought to embrace myldenes and curteſie, as one that hath a hart of fleſhe, not of ſtone, more encly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <pb facs="tcp:11283:69"/> to clemencye, then to crueltye: to the ende his conuerſation bee acceptable, by reaſon of his ſweete and louing behauiour, he muſt alſo be in minde mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not baſe or abiecte, as one ill borne, and worſe brought vp: for ſo will hee eaſilye be diſcerned from that raſcall ſorte of loſe minded companions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed of all ornamentes beſeeming a gentleman, whoſe repaire into companye is commonlye without vſing any curteſie or ſalutation, where hauing intruded themſelues among honeſt gentlemen, if chaunce they are acquainted with any of them, without crauing leaue either of him or the reſte of his companye, they take him by the ſleeue, vrging him to goe with them, without any conſideration of the perſon ſo taken, or of offence therby offered to the reſt of the company, who in all likely-hoode might be offended with his vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed follie, in playing ſo vnmannerlye a parte: thinking themſelues if not altogether wronged, yet at leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteouſly dealt withall, in that their company ſhould be ſo neglected &amp; little ſet by: inſomuch that through ſuch ill demeanour, they often-times purchaſe vnto themſelues muche iniurye. For it maye happen, that ſome fantaſticall madde conceited fellowe, taking this kinde of diſcurteſie in euill parte, will fall a reaſoning with him that offereth it, and ſo by multiplying of ſpeeche, they may fall from words to blowes, whereby ſome or other may be ſpoyled vpon a matter not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the talking of: for all men bee not of one minde, and a mad brainde fellow may eaſilie light vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as fond or fondlier fantaſticall then himſelf, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both of them may fall into diuers vnlooked for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences and miſcheefes on the ſodaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11283:70"/>Moreouer, at weddinges or great feaſtes, where is great reſorte both of gentlemen and gentlewomen, it may happen that a company of gentlemen retyre aſide from the reſt of the companye, taking with them ſome gentlewoman or other to deceiue the time with talke, or diſcourſe on ſome other paſtime: where if ſome one of theſe mannerles gentlemen ſhould chance to come and ſolicite the gentlewoman ſo retyred, to dance with him, without crauing either her good liking, or the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens with whom ſhe was diſcourſing, or otherwiſe paſsing ouer the time: vndoubtedlye, if ſome of the gentlemen of the ſame company ſhould happen to be mad conceited, hee might chaunce to be well beaten for his pleaſure: whereof alſo further inconuenience might ariſe, and perchaunce the whole mariage might therby be diſturbed, and quarrels might grow among the frends &amp; kinsfolk of either party, wherupon much hurly-burly maye enſue: and experience teacheth vs, that diuers men of account haue loſte their liues, vpon like diſorders. Whereupon I conclude, that modeſtye and curteſie are moſt conuenient ornaments, as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men ſhall auoide many dangers and quarrells.</p>
                  <p>There be alſo certaine vndiſcreetmen, whoſe groſſe fault I cannot ouerſlip without blaming: theſe men vſe as they either ſtand or go in ſtreets, ſo to ſtare and looke men paſsing by them in the face, as if they woulde for ſome reaſon marke them: which breedeth ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto ſome men ſo marked, that they cannot take it in good part, and therefore it is verie dangerous. For it maie happen, that a man may looke ſo vpon one that either is by nature ſuſpitious, or by reaſon of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing knowen to himſelfe, maie ſuſpect, that hee is
<pb facs="tcp:11283:70"/> therefore looked vpon. Wherevpon great quarrels may ariſe, for the man ſo looked on maie fall a queſtioning with him that looketh on him, who perhaps anſwering him ouerthwartly, may both moue him to choler, &amp; be moued himſelf alſo, &amp; ſo bring the matter to ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous point. Whereof I haue my ſelfe ſeene a notable example, paſſing through the Citie of Trieſte, in the vttermoſt part of the territories of
<hi>Friule</hi> in Italy, where I ſawe two brethren, one a moſt honorable Captaine, and the other a braue and worthie ſouldier, who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the ſtreetes, were verie ſtedfaſtly eied of certaine young Gentlemen of the Citie, who ſtared the Captaine and his brother in the face ſomething vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, and (as they tooke it) diſcurteouſlie: whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they asked the Gentlemen in verie curteous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whether they had ſeene them in anie place before, or whether they knew them. They anſwered no. Then replied the Captaine and his brother, Why then doo you looke ſo much vpon vs? They aunſwered, becauſe they had eies. That (ſayd the other) is the crowes fault, in that they haue not picked them out. To bee ſhort, in the end one word added on the other, and one ſpeech following the other, the matter came from ſaying, to doing: and what the tung had vttered the hand would maintaine: and a hot fight being commenced, it could not be ended before the Captaines brother was ſlaine, and two of the gentlemen hurt, whereof one eſcaped with the reſt, but the cheefeſt cutter of them all was hurt in the legge, and ſo could not get away, but was taken, impriſoned, and ſhortly after beheadded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was very well beloued in the Cittie, but yet could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape this end: being brought therto by following his
<pb facs="tcp:11283:71"/> mad brained conceits, and by beeing miſled by euill company: the reſt of his company were baniſhed their country. Now if theſe gentlemen had more curteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and wiſelye demeaned themſelues, no more hurte had followed that bad beginning: euerie man therfore ſhall doe well, to haue a great regarde in this reſpecte, leaſt like diſorders be to their danger committed.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I like not the cuſtome which ſome men haue in medling with other mens weapons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye with theirs that profeſſe armes, neither can I thinke it an ouer-wiſe parte for men to be viewing one the others Rapiers, whereof may this inconuenience riſe, that a man may ſo take occaſion to kill his enemie, towards whome in outward appearance hee carryeth him ſelfe as his verye freende: for all is not golde that gliſtereth, and you may think a man to be your freend, whoſe hart as it is hidde from your eyes, ſo alſo is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto you: all which miſcheefe may by diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fore-ſight be auoided, in offering no occaſion or opportunity for the effecting therof.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when men light into the companye of honorable Gentlemen, they ought to haue a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of their tung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end they ſay nothing which maye be euil taken or miſ-conſtred: and in talking or reaſoning to girde at any man, or finde fault with him, howbeit you may doe it neuer ſo truly, for it is ill play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo as it may pricke, and it is not good ieſting to the diſgrace of another.</p>
                  <p>It is no leſſe behouefull for men to beware that they entiſe or ſuborne not other mens ſeruants, which of it ſelfe is odious, and purchaſeth naught but ſhame and reproche to the performers of ſuch baſe practiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11283:71"/>I muſt alſo miſlike them that offer wrong to other mens ſeruants, for beſides this, that they bewraye their baſenes of minde, they ſeeme alſo to reſemble him of whom the prouerb ſaith, that being vnable to ſtrike the horſe, beats the ſaddle, which ſignifieth as much, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is not able to deale with the maiſter, he wreaketh it on the ſeruant: I hope therefore that gentle men will conſider how baſe a thing it is to doe this, and alſo how that often-times much hurt enſueth: for one houſe is by this means ſtirred vp againſt another, and whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are turned vp ſide downewarde: for whoſoeuer ſeeth his ſeruants abuſed, wil think him ſelfe wronged: and will therefore endeuour to reuenge ſuch wrongs, as offered vnto him ſelfe: according to the prouerbe, loue me and loue my dogge.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Gentlemen ought to abhorre carrying of tales, and reporting of other mens ſpeeches, for that is a very vnchriſtianly actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnworthy to proceed from a braue and free minded man: for ſuch as vſe tale-bearing, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times thinking to reporte but wordes, reporte that which cauſeth a mans deſtruction: on the other ſide, if any man chaunce to ſpeak euil of you in your abſence, you ought not to ſeeke meanes to bee reuenged of him that ſo doth, deſpiſing and contemning him. For a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying it hath been of olde time (be it ſpoken with reuerence) he that ſpeketh of me behinde my back, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with that which is behinde my back: And ſure it is that no man of value or vertue will ſpeak any thing of a man in his abſence, but rather to his face: neither muſt a man eaſilye giue credite to all thinges which he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, for whatſoeuer hee bee that carryeth tales, hee dooth not nor can not truely deliuer a mans ſpeeche
<pb facs="tcp:11283:72"/> wholie without addition or ſubſtraction: for a word or two is eaſily adioyned, which notwithſtanding is of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie ſufficient to alter the whole ſtate of the ſpeech. Which may moue anie man to thinke it a vaine matter for to go about to maintaine anie quarrell vpon no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds: and it may fall out, that by giuing credite to tales, one maie indanger himſelfe and his friends. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man ſhall therefore doo well to bridle his owne tongue, and to conſider of other mens ſpeeches before he credite them, and not report vnto his friende euerie thing he heareth ſpoken of him, except it concerne his life or reputation: for in ſuch a caſe a man ought to warne his frend, to the end he may be prouided againſt the wrong which is intended againſt him. And in this caſe alſo I wiſh this obſeruation to be kept, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie grieued firſt go to him which ſpake the wordes, and aske him in curteous manner (not without courage) whether he haue reported or ſpoken ſuch wordes, &amp;c. Which if he denie in preſence of credible perſons, then is he that reported it to bee charged with the iniurie: who if he acquite himſelfe by prouing that to bee true which he reported, yet conſidering that the partie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed hath denied them before witneſſe, you are to reſt ſatisfied and contented: for by denying them he recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, let euerie man take heed he maintain not anie diſhonoured or infamous perſons quarrell, of what condition or calling ſo euer he bee.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is wiſedome for a meane man not to deale with men of great calling, for he ſhall be ſure howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the matter go, to get little by it. And if chance, ſome occaſion of quarrell being offered, he let it ſlip, ſuffering <pb facs="tcp:11283:72"/> the matter to be taken vp, he ſhall doe well to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome place further of: for it is better for men to liue as freends aſunder, then as enemies together: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as elſe euerye ſmall matter that might happen, would renue the olde quarrell. Hence commeth it that this prouerbe was vſed. That the eye ſees not, the hart greeues not.</p>
                  <p>Contrarilye, a man of great calling and authoritye ought not to wrong any man of the meaner ſorte, for there be many who, howbeit they be but poor and of no authoritie, yet they wante neither valour nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and will rather dye, then take any iniurie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will rehearſe two or three examples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I haue my ſelfe ſeene.</p>
                  <p>There is a certaine village about a mile diſtant from the famous Cittie of <hi>Padua</hi> in <hi>Italye,</hi> where the
<hi>Boggia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> dwelt, men well to liue for their calling, wanting neither hart nor courage: and as it is a cuſtome throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Lombardie,</hi> in Sommer-time there be many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where in Caſtels and in Villages alſo, great markets and wakes be kept, vpon the daies of ſuch Saints as the pariſh Churches are dedicated vnto: whither reſorte merchants and Cuntry-men of all ſortes, from places farre and neere, to make merrie and good cheere, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing good Countrie muſicke: the yonger ſorte after dinner and ſupper vſe all exerciſe and paſtime, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with their loues on a fair greene, kept for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To which dauncing diuers gentlemen would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte, onely to ſee the cuntrymen and women ſporting and vſing their rurall paſtimes: among which gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were two nephewes to the Duke, who eſpying two maidens among the cuntry wenches ſurpaſsing all
<pb facs="tcp:11283:73"/> the reſt in beautie and comelines, being ſiſters to the
<hi>Boggiarini,</hi> fell into ſuch liking of them, that within ſome fewe daies they went vnto the houſe of the ſaide <hi>Boggiarini,</hi> accompanied with certaine gallant youths, thinking by giftes and faire ſmoothing ſpeeche, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and entice the maidens to become their para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, &amp; to follow them home to their places: but the maidens father and two of their Bretheren, came to the gentlemen, hauing had an inckling of their intent, and tolde them that they were very poore, and not able to entertaine them according to their calling, yet that notwithſtanding ſuch was their honeſtie, that they greatly regarded their reputation: wherefore if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to come to their houſe with honeſt intent, they would ſtretch their power to the vttermoſt to ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, and their gratefulnes of minde towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their curteſie in vouchſafing to come vnto them: but if they came to any other intent then vertuous, then they beſeeched them to departe. Heereupon the madde youths that accompanied the Gentlemen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to drawe vpon the countrymen, who being leſſe in number farre then the gentlemen, were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and ſaue themſelues in their houſe, and for that time the matter was ſo ended. But not long after the <hi>Boggiarini</hi> chaunced to meete with ſome of theſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, where two of them were ſhrewdly handled: for which cauſe the two
<hi>Boggiarini</hi> were committed to cloſe priſon by the Maieſtrates, and remained ſo for the ſpace of eleuen or twelue moneths, and then were releaſed: the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderſtanding that they ſhould be releaſed, departed ſoddenlye the next day from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, with ſeauen luſtie fellowes well armed, intending <pb facs="tcp:11283:73"/> to kil the <hi>Boggiarini,</hi> and ſo went to Padua: on the other ſide, the <hi>Boggiarinies</hi> kinſemen being informed of their coſins releaſe out of priſon, haſtened to Padua to bring them home, and carried them their weapons: they therefore hauing diſcharged all duties, after they were ſet at libertie, tooke their iourney in hand and went homeward, but the gentlemen meeting them at a place called
<hi>Seruy,</hi> ruſhed violentlye vpon them on the ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, crying all with a loud voice, kill, kill, kill: they not knowing what they ment at firſt, but quickly after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued who they were, would not willinglye haue had to do with them, as by othes and proteſtations they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, defending themſelues as well as they could, and retiring backe to eſcape them: but beeing compaſſed round about, and ſeeing no way to eſcape death but by the death of thoſe that aſſailed them, when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that neither intreatie nor proteſtation, nor anye thing could moue the reuengfull Gentlemen to holde their handes, euen after ſo many iniuries before that by them offered, as hauing gone about to violate their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, hauing beaten their father, and hauing obtained puniſhment for themſelues by the Maieſtrates, with a yeeres impriſonment, being content with nothing but their liues, at length after they had retired much, and ſought all meanes to auoyde the fight, they began to ſet aparte all reſpectes, abandoning their liues: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon laying about them with all ſtrength and no leſſe courage, in ſhort ſpace they ſlew the Dukes Nephewes both, and another Gentleman, and hurt diuers of the others that accompanied them, onely one of the <hi>Boggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arini</hi> beeing harmed with the loſſe of three fyngers. The fight being ended, one of the <hi>Boggiarini</hi> getting <pb facs="tcp:11283:74"/> on a Millars horſe eſcaped, the other three purpoſing to ſaue themſelues in a Monaſterie, were taken and put in priſon: afterward their cauſe being brought before the Councell of <hi>Venice,</hi> an vncle of the gentlemen that were ſlaine, vnder-tooke the patronage and defence of the poore cuntrymen, (they beeing in truth guiltleſſe) and making a ſpeech for them, obtained ſo much that they ſaued their liues, howbeit they were baniſhed out of all the territories of the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſeignory. The ende of theſe gentlemen that were ſo pittifully ſlaine, maye be an example to all others how to behaue themſelues towards men of meaner degree.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame cittie of <hi>Padua,</hi> happened another cauſe not much vnlike to this, between a Gentleman of <hi>Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> and a Baker. This gentleman hauing many houſes in that citie, (in one of which a baker was tenant) vpon ſome ſmall occaſion, gaue the baker warning to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide him another houſe: the baker being an honeſt man got all his neighbours to intreate the gentleman to let him continue his tenant, but their intreatie ſerued not, and the poore man to his vtter vndoing, was thruſt out of his houſe, which ſo greeued him, that hee vowed his Landlords death: who hauing had ſome notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, tooke as great heed as he coulde, continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home before night, leaſt by his late being abroad he might be endangered. Thus two yeeres being paſt, hee began by little and little to wexe more careleſſe, thinking in that ſpace a man might forget any wrong: but the poor baker had not ſo forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that great iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for I haue heard many ſay, that the offender writeth in the ſand, but the offended in marble: &amp; ſo this baker meeting the Gentleman late in the night, haſtilye run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <pb facs="tcp:11283:74"/> into a ſhoppe where Cheeſe and ſuch like thinges were ſolde, where borrowing a knife, maketh after his olde Landlord, and ouertaking him, cutteth his throte, ſo that the Gentleman within fewe howers dyed, and the Baker was banniſhed by the Maieſtrates, becauſe they could not otherwiſe puniſh him, he being fled.</p>
                  <p>I haue read in the hiſtorie of the laſt warres in
<hi>Perſia,</hi> how <hi>Mahomet Baſſa</hi> Generall of the Turkiſhe Empire, tooke a certaine penſion from a Souldier (who for his valour had well deſerued it) and beſtowed it on ſome other whom he better thought of: wherupon the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier being with great reaſon offended, feigned himſelf madde, and the better to effect his purpoſe, ſeemed to think that he had entred into ſome order of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan religion, and ſo came dayly into the Baſſaes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mumbling out his praiers, whereat hee and all the reſt about him laughed, but the ſouldier vſed this ſo often, till eſpying fit opportunity he ſlew the Baſſa, and being taken and brought before the great Turke, was by him giuen to the Baſſaes ſlaues to do their pleaſure with him, for hee had confeſſed the whole matter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Turke.</p>
                  <p>Before the ouerthrow of the Turkiſh Nauie, which was in the yeere 1571. the Sates of Venice had a little before ſent <hi>Sfortia Palauiſino</hi> their Generall into Slauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia by land, and into other Eaſterne partes, with that authoritie as in time of warres Generals vſe to haue: he being arriued in thoſe places, eſpied opportunity to take a certaine Cittie called Margarita, in a countrie: wherefore hee leauyed an armye with all ſpeede, and marching towarde the Cittie, planted his ordinance, and began to batter the walles of the ſame Cittie. At <pb facs="tcp:11283:75"/> the aſſaulte wherof he bare in his hand a kinde of pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe, with a thing like a hammer at one end, and a long pike at the ſtaffe ende, able to pierce any bodie armed with a curats: which kinde of weapon is much vſed by the Sclauonians, Croacians, Turkes, Albanoies, and Hungarians: with this pickaxe did <hi>Sforcia Palauicino</hi> encourage his ſouldiers to ſtrike thoſe that returned from the aſſaulte, or were not ſo forward as they ought to haue beene, and among others would haue ſtricken a certaine Venetian Gentleman, whoſe ſeruant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtept before his maiſter to
<hi>Sforcia</hi> with his peece in his hand, and bad him holde his hand, for that hee whom he went about to ſtrike was a gentleman of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice and his maiſter, and therefore willed him to take heede of touching him, purpoſing, if <hi>Sforcia</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from his maiſter, to ſhoote him through with his Peece. <hi>Sforcia</hi> noting and admiring the fellows valour and fidelitie, in hazarding his owne life to ſaue his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from wrong, earneſtlye requeſted the Gentleman, to let that his ſeruant bee his, promiſing to ſhewe him much fauour, which the Gentleman both to gratifie
<hi>Sforcia</hi> and to aduaunce his man to preferment, did: and
<hi>Sforcia</hi> made him a Captain, and wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched him, inſomuch that in fewe yeeres after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great man.</p>
                  <p>It is a groſſe follye for men to ſcoffe and ieſt at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in what caſe ſoeuer it be: neither ought thoſe men who by nature are framed comely and tall, to be girding at thoſe vnto whome nature hath not been ſo beneficiall. There be many that being carried away with plauſible conceite of their owne manhoode and ſtrength, by reaſon of the propernes and greatnes of <pb facs="tcp:11283:75"/> their well ſhapen bodies, deſpiſe men of leſſe ſtature, thinking that in reſpect of themſelues they be nothing, and that if occaſion were offered them to fight with them, they thinke they were able to minſe them as ſmal as pye-meat, not knowing that men are not meaſured as woollen Cloth by the yarde, or that little men haue oftentimes ouerthrowen great fellowes. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, I will recount vnto you what happened in Italye, in the Cittie of Boulogna.</p>
                  <p>When the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, came to be crowned by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth. This Emperour had in his traine, a great Moore like a Giant, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his tallnes wanted no valour and courage, beeing wonderfull ſtrong: he enioying the fauour of ſo great an Emperour, was reſpected of all men, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of diuers Princes which accompanied the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: which brought him to ſuch a proud conceite of himſelfe, and his owne worthines (aſcribing the good fauour of all the Princes and gentlemen that followed the Emperour to his own deſerts, and not to the good will that they ſawe the Emperour bare him) that hee laughed al men to ſcorn, thinking none able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him.</p>
                  <p>Whereuppon hee obtained leaue of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that proclaimation ſhoulde bee made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if any one in all that Citie being ſo ful of people, would wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with him, hee would challenge him: which being publiſhed, euery man was ſorelye afraide of his huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſtrength, and eager countenance. Inſomuch that none could be found that durſt vndertake the match, ſaue the Duke of Mantuaes Brother called
<hi>Rodomont,</hi> who though he was but of an ordinary ſtature, yet was
<pb facs="tcp:11283:76"/> he both very ſtrong and nimble withall, and (as it was credibly thought,) all his breſt was wholy made of one bone: he was very valiant, and by reporte could break at one courſe ſeauen ſtaues tyed together, inſomuch that if he had not had a good horſe, he ſhould break his backe: but for many raſh enterpriſes, he was banniſhed from all tylt-yardes and iuſting. This <hi>Rodomont</hi> ſeeing that no man elſe durſte vndertake to bee matched in wreſtling with the proude boaſting Moore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that his brother the Duke and the reſt of his kinred vſed all meanes to diſſwade him, would neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe himſelfe wreſtle with him, to make it knowen vnto all the worlde, that he would not ſuffer ſo beaſtlie a creature, to ſtaine the honor of Italian Gentlemen, and to giue the Emperour (who was a ſtranger) occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to laugh at the Italians, ſeeing them put downe by a monſtrous Moore.
<hi>Rodomont</hi> therefore buckling with the Moore in preſence of the Emperour and all the Princes, behaued himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that the Moore could not foyle him with any fall, inſomuch that hee was brought only to touch the ground with one knee, howbeit the Moore ſtrained himſelfe to the vttermoſt ſtrength: and ſo the night drawing on, after they had tryed their force a long time, the Emperour cauſed them to ceaſe till next daye, at which time <hi>Rodomont</hi> came to meete the Moore againe with great courage, and hauing now had good triall of his ſtrength, and knowing what he was able to doe, as ſoone as he ſawe fitte opportunitie, nimblye tooke the Moore about the middle, and claſped him hard againſt his owne breſt, holding him ſo vntill he perceiued him to be breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and then letting him ſlippe out of his armes, the <pb facs="tcp:11283:76"/> Moore fell down dead ſo heauilie, that the whole place ſhaked, as if ſome ſteeple had beene caſt downe: which <hi>Rodomont</hi> perceiuing, preſentlye got from the whole company, and taking poſte horſſe fled, fearing leaſt the Emperour ſhould haue doone him ſome diſpleaſure: but hee wente not about it, conſidering that the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge was publiquelye proclaimed by his owne leaue and authoritie. Howbeit hee was greeued for the loſſe of his ſtout Moore.</p>
                  <p>One example more will I recount concerning inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencye, eſpeciallye becauſe this <hi>Rodomont</hi> of whome I ſpake, was an actor in the tragedie. It happened that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and his brother
<hi>Rodomont</hi> being in the ſame Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> his Court about certain affaires of their owne, they on a time walked in a great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, expecting that the Emperour ſhould ſend for them when his Maieſtie were at leaſure: into which cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at the ſame time, came a certain Spaniſh Captaine, who without any greeting or ſalutation, came by them and brauely walked, euen betweene the Duke and his brother, nothing reſpecting the greatnes of that prince, and ſo braued them three or foure times: wherewith
<hi>Rodomont</hi> being greatlye offended, with the diſcurteſie of this proud and inſolent Captain, went to a window which he perceiued to be open, and ſtaying til the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine came that way, tooke him by the coller with one hand, and putting the other vnder his breeche, thruſt him out at the windowe, and brake his necke: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he fled from the Court with all ſpeede he could. But the Emperour being enformed of the matter, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not
<hi>Rodomont,</hi> conſidering the Spaniſhe Captaine had ſo inſolently behaued himſelfe to <hi>Rodomonts</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb facs="tcp:11283:77"/> the Duke of
<hi>Mantua.</hi> It were an endleſſe thing for me to rehearſe all the examples that I haue heard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this vice of inſolencie, which are infinite, and happen dayly in all countries, by reaſon of the little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde that is had in the bringing vp of yong men: and ſo I will only exhorte euery man to take heed leaſt him ſelfe fall into like follie.</p>
                  <p>I will not omit to ſpeake of a certaine vice, and parte not to be vſed by a gentleman, ſeeing it proceedeth of meere cowardiſe: which is, when a man hauing fallen out with one or other, and wanting courage to deale with him in ſingle fight, procureth baſe and cowardlie meanes by the help of ſome of his freends, with whom he plotteth how they may circumuent his enemy. And ſo watching him at ſome time or other, will draw vpon him, as if hee had mette him by chaunce, who thinking vpon no villanie, without any ſuſpition at all, likewiſe draweth to defende himſelfe, as a man ought to doe, which when the other plotters eſpie ſtanding a far off, drawe neere as ſtrangers to them both, and vnwilling any hurt ſhould be done on either ſide, whereas they moſt traiterouſlie will either themſelues impart a thruſt by the way, or ſo ſtrike his weapon, that his enemy may take occaſion to hurt him: which villanie (for I thinke no term bad inough to expreſſe it by) you may eſcape, if you take heede when any one draweth vpon you, that none elſe come neere you, willing them to retire, with proteſtation, that you will take them as your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they doe not: for by reaſon that you knowe them not, they cannot but like of your proteſtation, if they meane you no euill, ſeeing that you not knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not aſſure your ſelf of their good affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb facs="tcp:11283:77"/> you, and care of your ſafegarde. Therfore in any caſe, at ſuch time as you ſhal happen to be enforced to defende your ſelfe on the ſodaine, let no man come neere you, for it is very dangerous: and I ſpeake this becauſe I haue ſeene the like doone verye often, and found it confirmed by great experience. And to ſaye ſome thing of parting, I will by the way declare thus much. That hee that will parte two that are fighting, muſt go betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, hauing great regarde that he nether hindreth one more then the other, nor ſuffereth the one more to endanger his enemie than the other: and if more come to parte then one, they muſt deuide themſelues, and ſome come on one ſide, and ſome on the other, taking great heede that neither of them be any way either preiudiced, or fauoured: wherefore I doe not miſlike with the great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who vpon paine of great forfeiture, forbad all men to parte thoſe that ſhould fight, for hee would haue them ſuffered to fight til they parted themſelues, and if any one chaunced to be hurt, they ſhould blame themſelues, ſeeing they were the onelye cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>If the like were vſed in all places, I thinke we ſhould not haue ſo muche quarrelling by halfe as wee daylye ſee among Gentlemen: for ſurely manye will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye readye vpon no occaſion to drawe vpon a man, onely becauſe he knoweth that he ſhall not be ſuffered to fight.</p>
                  <p>Some others there be, who to wreake themſelues vpon their enemies will doe it by a thirde meanes, by giftes or promiſes, perſwading ſome needy fellow to picke a quarrell, with their enemy, whom either the
<pb facs="tcp:11283:78"/> poore fellow hurteth or killeth, and ſo encurreth dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death: or at the leaſt is hurte or maimed himſelf. Therfore I could wiſh euery man to meddle with his own quarrels only, neither reuenging his own wrong, by another, nor wreaking other mens iniuries by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, vnleſſe he haue good reaſon to the contrarie, as in diuers caſes a man may honeſtlie and honorably both intreat others to reuenge his wrongs, and be alſo intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of others.</p>
                  <p>There be alſo ſome gentlemen ſo careleſſe, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in companye with honeſt gentlemen, thinke that whatſoeuer follie they commit, the companye will be ready to defend them, and ſo will either ſcoffe or gybe with them that paſſe by, or vſe ſome knauiſhe tricke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſome one that is not of their companye, or fall a quarrelling with one or other whom they think good, and ſo hauing ſet manye together by the eares, they are the firſt that will runne awaye, or hide themſelues in ſome corner till all be done. By my counſel therfore ſhall no man be ſo fond as to backe anye, or take parte with any that are ſo void of diſcretion or gouernment.</p>
                  <p>Like vnto theſe you ſhall ſee others, who will inuite their freends to ſome dinner or paſtime abroad, onely to ſerue their turnes in reuenging their wronges, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing plotted meanes for the execution thereof, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many times much harme hath beene doone, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cauſe any man to beware of falling into like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences.</p>
                  <p>All which I haue heere ſayde, becauſe I haue my ſelfe had experience thereof. And theſe bee the things whereof quarrelles proceede, which beginning but betweene two or three, ſomtime are ſo farre increaſed, <pb facs="tcp:11283:78"/> that whole families are wrapped in quarrels and broils, which oftentimes are not ended without great hurt &amp; bloudſhed. Euerie man ought therefore to know how to behaue himſelfe in theſe caſes, and not to preſume vpon his owne skil or knowledge, but to learne how he ought to proceed in matters of combats or quarrelles: For a man maie dayly learne more than he knoweth, &amp; eſpecially they that want experience: ſeeing it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeldome ſeene, that he ſhall be able to know what is good, that hath not had ſome triall of that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. According to a verſe of Petrarke, Euerie one muſt learne to his coſt: which ſaying pertaineth eſpecially to young men, who for the moſt parte can neuer learne to gouern themſelues aright, vntill ſuch time as they haue had experience of ſome miſhappe or other, concerning either their goods, life, or credite. But as nothing is ſo daungerous but maie bee preuented, ſo in this pointe, that men take good heed and arme themſelues with the ſure ſhield of ſound counſell and aduice, that they may eaſily auoide ſuch errors as I haue in theſe my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements diſcouered and made knowen for their profit &amp; commoditie.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL iniuries are reduced to two kindes, and are either by wordes or deedes. In the firſt, he that offereth the iniurie ought to bee the Challenger: in the later, hee that is iniuried: Example, Caius ſayth to
<pb facs="tcp:11283:79"/> Seius that hee is a traitour: vnto which Seius aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by giuing the lie: whereuppon enſueth, that the charge of the Combat falleth on Caius, becauſe hee is to maintaine what hee ſayd, and therefore to challenge Seius. Now when an iniurie is offered by deede, then do they proceed in this manner. Caius ſtriketh Seius, giueth him a boxe on the eare, or ſome other waie hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him by ſome violent meanes: Wherewith Seius offended, ſaith vnto Caius, that hee hath vſed violence towardes him, or that hee hath dealt iniuriouſlie with him, or that hee hath abuſed him, or ſome ſuch manner of ſaying. Wherevnto Caius aunſwereth, Thou lyeſt: whereby Seius is forced to challenge Caius, and to compell him to fight, to maintaine the iniurie which hee had offered him. The ſumme of all therefore, is in theſe caſes of honour, that hee vnto whome the lie is wrongfullie giuen, ought to challenge him that offereth that diſhonour, and by the ſwoorde to proue himſelfe no lyer.</p>
                        <p>There bee manie that delighting to finde faulte with that which is ſette downe by others, bee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo truely and exactly perfourmed, will in this caſe alſo ſeeke to ouerthrowe the rules which I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue alleadged concerning Challenging and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, oppoſing manye Argumentes and obiections, which I thinke friuolous to trouble the Reader withall, and therefore wyll neyther rehearſe them heere, nor ſpende ſo much labour in vaine as to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them, conſidering that men but of meane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie will bee able to diſcerne and iudge of the ſmall reaſon that they are grounded vppon. For who is ther that ſeeth not, howbeit ſome men finer witted than <pb facs="tcp:11283:80"/> endued with valour and courage, will by multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpeeches giue cauſe of greater offence, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giue the other occaſion to challenge the combat, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to do it themſelues. Yet that notwithſtanding the true and perfect manner of proceeding in caſes of honour is, that whoſoeuer offereth iniurie by deede, as ſtriking, beating, or otherwiſe hurting anie man, ought preſently without anie further debate or queſtioning, to be challenged to the Combat, vnleſſe hee refuſe the ſame by making ſatisfaction for the offence or offered iniurie.</p>
                        <p>And in iniuries offered by worde, no reſpect ought to bee had of all the wordes which by aunſweres and replies are multiplied, (as when one ſaith, Thou lyeſt, the other anſwereth with the ſame wordes, and the firſt replieth, with thou lieſt alſo, and ſo maie perchaunce make a fraie with wordes only, which fooliſh and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh manner of proceeding cannot but bee miſliked of by Gentlemen of reputation) but to whom ſo euer the lie is vniuſtlye and wrongfully giuen, vnto him ſhall it belong to become Challenger, by Armes to maintaine what he ſpake or did, whervpon the lie was giuen him.</p>

                        <head>What the reaſon is, that the partie vnto whom the lie is giuen, ought to become Challenger: and of the nature of Lies.</head>
                        <p>SOme men maruell why that hee vnto whome the lie is giuen, ought rather to challenge the Combat, than <pb facs="tcp:11283:80"/> hee that is called a traitor or a villaine, or by ſome other iniurious name, ſeeing that it woulde ſeeme more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that hee which is moſt iniuried, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Challenger, and not the other, and that this is a greater iniurie to ſaie vnto a man, Thou art a theefe, thou art a villaine, &amp; a traitor, than this, Thou lyeſt. But the lawes haue no regarde of the wordes, or of the force or efficacie of them, but prouide that the burthen of the challenge ſhall euer fall on him that offereth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie: for it is thought that euerie man is honeſt, iuſt, and honourable vntill the contrarie bee proued. And therefore as in common triall by ciuill iudgement and order of lawe, whoſoeuer is accuſed of anie crime, is by ſimple denying the ſame deliuered from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnleſſe further proofe thereof be brought agaynſt him: euen ſo in this caſe, whoſoeuer ſpeaketh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man contrarie vnto that which is ordinarilie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed of him, it is great reaſon that the charge of proof ſhould lie vppon him, to make that manifeſt vnto the worlde by force of Armes, that ſuch a man is guiltie of ſuch and ſuch thinges as hee hath laide to his charge. Heereuppon ſome maie cauell, and aske howe that hee that is iniuried by deede ſhall become challenger, (as I haue ſayde) if that the lawes prouide that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof ſhall belong vnto him that offereth the iniurie.</p>
                        <p>Wherevnto I aunſwere, that if I beate or ſtrike anie man, thereof proceedeth no cauſe of proofe, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that I offend or hurt him, and I know no cauſe why I ſhoulde proue that I doo ſo. But if the other ſaie vnto mee, that I did not as a Gentleman worthie to beare
<pb facs="tcp:11283:81"/> Armes, or that I dealt not honorably, or any ſuch thing, I repell his ſayings with the Lie, and force him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what hee hath ſpoken: whereof I am acquited with ſole deniall, till hee make further proofe.</p>
                        <p>And now as concerning the nature of Lies, I ſaye that euerie deniall, bee it neuer ſo ſimple, beareth the force of a Lie, beeing altogether as much in effect. And I ſee no other difference betweene a ſimple denyall and the lie, than is betwixte a ſpeech more or leſſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Wherefore although the names of deniall are diuerſe, as Thou lyeſt, Thou ſayeſt vntruly, Thou ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt falſely, Thou ſpareſt the truth, Thou telleſt tales, Thou regardeſt not how falſely thou reporteſt a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Thou art wide from the truth, This is a lie, a tale, a falſehood, &amp;c. Yet all theſe manners of ſpeech import the Lie, whether hee vnto whome they were ſpoken ſpake iniuriouſly or no. For though I ſaie not anie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill thing of anie other, but chance to diſcourſe of ſome matter, or rehearſe ſome tale or hiſtorie, or reporte any thing, as occaſion of ſpeeche may bee offered mee, if ſome one that ſtandeth by telleth mee that I ſaie not truely, or vſe anie of the foreſayde formes or manner of ſpeech vnto mee, ſurely hee bringeth my truth in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and cauſeth mee to bee reputed for a lyar, and ſo conſequently offereth mee iniurie. And foraſmuch as euerie iniurie offered by wordes, maie be the firſt time wreaſted and returned vppon him that offereth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, I maie lawfullie repulſe that iniurie with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde denyall, which ſhall beare the force of a Lye, where his firſt ſhall bee accounted of the nature of an <pb facs="tcp:11283:81"/> iniurie, by which meanes the burthen of the challenge ſhall reſt wholie vpon him. But if hee chaunce to ſaie onely thus, or after this manner vnto mee, This is not ſo, or the truth heereof I take to bee otherwiſe, &amp;c. I cannot take anie ſuch ſpeech iniuriouſly, for it may be the thing whereof I ſpake is not true, and yet I doo not lie, and therefore ſuch a ſpeeche ſo ſpoken cannot anie wayes burthen mee, vnleſſe I ſhall make ſome iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous replie thereunto, which hee repealing with the lye, maye laye the burthen of challenge on mee: for a worde commeth ſometimes to bee iniuryous, and ſometimes not, onelye by beeing ſometimes iniuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, and ſometimes not. As for example: If one man doo ſaye vnto another, Thou ſayeſt not true, hee dooth thereby make him a Lyer, and ſo hee doth iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him. But if hee doo replye and ſaie in this manner, That which thou ſayeſt is not ſo, or it is not true, &amp;c. No ſuch manner of ſpeech or ſaying can bee iniurious, for that, as I haue aboue ſayde, the thing may bee falſe, and yet hee no Lyer, by reaſon that hee eyther maye bee euyll infourmed, or elſe not vnderſtande the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it was, or ſome ſuche other thing might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whereby hee might bee mooued to reporte and ſpeake that agayne which is not true: wherefore anie ſuch aunſwere whatſoeuer cannot in anie ſort fall bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denous vnto him. One caſe excepted, which is, if hee ſaie that hee dyd ſuche a thing, or that hee dyd ſaie ſuch a thing, or that hee had beene about ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that hee dealte in ſuch a caſe, &amp;c. And another anſwere him that he did not, or that the ſame which he ſayd was not true, &amp;c. For ſo hee is burdened beeing
<pb facs="tcp:11283:82"/> accounted a lyer, becauſe a man cannot bee miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in anie thing which he ſayd or did himſelfe, which iniurie hee is to repulſe with the lie, and ſo the charge of challenge remaineth on the other, vnleſſe hee in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee dyd or ſayde ſuch or ſuch a thing, doo thereby offer ſome man iniurie, who by giuing the Lie maie repulſe the ſame iniurie, and ſo caſt the charge of challenge vpon him. To conclude, by all this which is ſayde it manifeſtly appeareth, that whoſoeuer taketh heed that hee offer no offence in his wordes or ſpeech, ſhall neuer bee endangered to bee iniuried with the lie.</p>

For to haue the lye giuen lawfully, it is requiſite that the cauſe whereupon it is giuen, be particularlye ſpecified and declared.

And to this lye it is holden of braue men of reuerence, that no man is bound to anſwer the ſame: which ſeemeth to me to be excellent well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, becauſe this charge or impoſition maye ſeeme to touche manye, beeing that manye haue ſpoken the ſame, and ſo one with many ſhould be bound to fight: which were to graunt an inconuenience directly, for it is not allowed that any man ſhould enter into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat more then once for one quarrell, and that no man ſhal put his honor vpon another mans ſword or valor: ſo might it come to paſſe that ſuch a one might take the quarel, that the lie was neuer meant vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherupon, to auoid ſuch diſorders, the beſt meane is, that this lie ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not adiudged lawful, nor approued for ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:84"/>The other lye which we haue termed generall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the iniury, is this: <hi>Antony</hi> thou haſt ſpoke ill of me, or thou haſt ſaide ſomewhat in preiudice of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and therefore I ſay that thou haſt lyed. This lye for that it is vpon words in which the lye eſpecially declared not what is the thing from whence the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was, or ſpeeche preiudiciall to reputation ſpoken is, for that in many ſortes a man maye be ill ſpoken of, and ones reputation preiudiced: happening verye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that hee whoſoeuer talketh of another man, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers matters ſpeaketh that which hee of whome they were ſpoken, might eſteeme them to his ſhame and diſgrace: and therefore it is moſt neceſſary to expreſſe the point whereupon he holdeth himſelfe offended: to the end that it may be conſidered,<note place="margin">Specification of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note> whither hee wil take vpon him to proue his ſayings, or whither he wil proue it with his weapon, or ciuillye by the lawe. And thus for theſe cauſes this lye cannot be accompted no waies of value nor lawfull: and he that hath giuen the ſame, if hee will come to the definition or determination of quarrell, muſt write the particular and declare it: for in right hee is bound ſo to doe, if ſo much time bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                        <p>And this I ſay, a lye giuen in this ſorte, doth not only binde, but is verye dangerous to bee wreſted, and the danger whereof I ſpeake, is thus: as by this caſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you may eaſilie ſee.
<hi>Paul</hi> vnderſtandeth that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> hath ſaide of him that he is an Vſurer, and hauing vnderſtanding of theſe wordes, writeth vnto him. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> thou haſt ſpoken ill of mee, and therefore I ſaye thou lyeſt. <hi>Paul</hi> peraduenture knowing many defaults more then this in <hi>Nicholas,</hi> maye anſwere him thus: I <pb facs="tcp:11283:84"/> confeſſe that I haue ſpoken ill of thee, but I ſpecified the particularitie of that which thou haſt doone, and I ſaide that long ſince thou committedſt ſuch a fault, and ſuch another, and ſhew how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus bring foorth the ground of his ſpeech, without making mention at all of that particularity of which <hi>Paul</hi> charged him with: and this maye adde more, that ſo thou lyeſt thy ſelfe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I ſpeaking ill of thee doe lye. Heere if <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to write, ſhould reply, I ſay that thou lyeſt in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am an Vſurer. Not for all this ſhall his lye make him guiltie, becauſe the generall lye permitting an exception, it maye be well wreſted, being apparant that in ſpeaking ill of <hi>Paul, Nicholas</hi> did not lye. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt lye is accompted falſe, it is to be preſumed that alſo the ſecond containeth a kinde of falſetie: for whoſoeuer is accounted once naught, is alwaies eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med naught in the ſame kinde: and the preſumption being againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> it behoueth him to be the actor, ſo as for the effect in the generalitie of the lye, he ſhal fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this inconuenience. Beſides, ſuch may be his default as the ſame by lawe might be proued againſt him, that neither as Defendant or Plaintife, he may enter the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ello or combat. I conclude therefore, for the ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie of the generall lye, that it hath qualitie to put an other man to the paines of proofe: as for the danger that it bringeth with her, all cauilieres, and braue men ought to take heede of it altogither. Although there were no other thing, then to auoide the multitude of cartelles, being a thing more comely for gentlemen to binde themſelues to the action, then lay themſelues open with many words.</p>

Neither muſt that lye be called lawfull which is giuen with more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than the iniury was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe no reſpect ought to withdrawe me to anſwere him who doeth iniurie or hurt, ſo that he be not armed, or ſo accompanied, that I anſwering him, hee might doo me wrong in oddes of weapon, in ſuch maner iniuring me, I ought not vnſaie my worde in ſeeking my aduauntage, yet it is certaine, that if anie perſon, I hauing meanes to doo ſuperſticery and wrong, ſhould charge me with infamy, I ought not to ſtaie from giuing him the lie therefore, for ſo is my dementie or lie lawfull. Neither can he alledge, that my <pb facs="tcp:11283:87"/> challenge therein was ſuperſticery, the fault being to be giuen by him who ſawe me ſo aduantaged vnder him, &amp; would come to outrage me. But Gentlemen out of this caſe muſt obſerue, that the lie or dementie ought to be giuen in more honeſt manner than the iniuries are done. And if that one far off thee haue ſpoken ill of thee thou ſtraight maiſt giue him the ly, &amp; maiſt write to him that he lieth in his throat, and ſo likewiſe preſent. And if he haue written anie thing in preiudice of thy reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou by writing maiſt anſwere him, and very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably thou maiſt alſo giue it him preſent. And ſeeing now mention is made of writing to him who farre of ſpeaketh ill of another, I will adde this, that I know that of ſome it is ſaid, that whoſoeuer is the firſt that writeth he is accounted Chalenger, which opinion is in no fort to be allowed, for the Challenger is he that moueth the quarrell, and he offereth the quarrell that giueth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, whether it be by worde or deede preſent or farre off: and for that the other ſhall not preiudice the matter with the maner of writing, the writing firſt or laſt is no matter at all. But I haue ſeene it diſputed amongeſt the wiſeſt ſorte of Gentlemen, that cartelles of demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or giuing the lie, beeing heere and there caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, euery one did defend for themſelues to bee the firſt that publiſhed, pretending amongeſt themſelues, that he who was the firſt that wrote haſt the beſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe wee haue ſpoken of ſuperſticerie, which is not onely conſidered in reſpect of the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of weapons or of perſons, but for reſpect of priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged places, or the ſight of the prince, where it is not lawfull for one that he maye freely ſhewe his griefe.
<pb facs="tcp:11283:88"/> Heere one may aske me what hee ought to do, if in the preſence of the Prince, one will giue mee outragious wordes?<note place="margin">An anſwere in the view of the Prince.</note> To this I will alwaies thus aunſwere, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ought to let paſſe the repulſe by the lye, nor the Prince ought at all to take it in diſdaine, for hee ought rather to bee tollerated that giueth another a repulſe of an iniurie, then he who doth it. and hee that beareth that in his preſence an iniurie ſhould be done me, of a greater reaſon ought to beare that I defende the ſame: but yet ſo, and with ſuch reuerence muſt he anſwer the ſame by aduenture, as the ſame may ſeeme full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie. And this I will now ſaye, that ſo much the more I holde my ſelfe bound to anſwere, by how much that I know that he that did me iniurie, is accounted of the Prince, before whom I may be accuſed: but heerein I preſcribe no lawe to any body, but onely ſhewe mine opinion, which whoſoeuer followeth, ſhall doe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and for his reputation: whom it ſhall not like to followe, let cuſtome ſtand in ſtead of lawe.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O come to the ende of this Treatiſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menties or giuing the lie, and to conclude the queſtion of the Challenger &amp; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, ſeeing alreadie wee haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that hee to whome the lie is giuen for repulſe of an iniurie, he is properly the Defendant. To the ende that more cleere contentment therein may be giuen, we are verie diligently to examine the lawfull dementies or lies, and by this examination remember our ſelues (if it be conuenient) of thoſe things which before wee haue treated of, and of their manner, and principally of the proper nature of the Lie, the which is to put backe the iniurie: and when it doth not this office, it becommeth of it ſelfe an iniurie, and with another lie the ſame may be repelled: and vpon this conſideration, I ſaie that the Lie maie be giuen in the affirmatiue, and ſo vppon the negatiue, and ſometime it falleth out, that vpon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue it cannot be giuen, and ſometime vppon the negatiue it hath no place, and ſo conſequentlye both heere and there beeing giuen, it maie bee wreaſted and ſent backe, and yet it may bee giuen both in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and negation in the ſame quarrell, without that
<pb facs="tcp:11283:89"/> it may bee ſubiecte to anie repulſe of either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>And heere of each my opinion, I will giue an example, The Lie lawfully giuen vpon the affirmatiue, is ſuch as before wee haue ſet downe more than in one manner. One ſayth of another, that he is a rebell vnto his Lorde, he who anſwereth, ſayth that he lyeth. This lie cannot bee auoided, beeing that it is giuen in the repulſe of the ſlaunder which is layed vpon him. But if I ſhoulde ſaie of anie man, that he were an honeſt man, &amp; one ſhould giue mee the Lie vpon theſe wordes, in this it requireth not repulſe but an iniurie, and I may ſaie, that he ſhould lie that thinketh that I ſhoulde lie. Now is it his parte to proue that he is not an honeſt man, as well by reaſon I gaue him cauſe of iniurie, as alſo that it is preſumed of euerie one that hee is honeſt, if the contrarie cannot be apparently proued: and whoſoeuer ſayth that another is vnhoneſt, muſt proue his fault therin committed, for the which hee ought not to bee eſteemed an honeſt man.</p>
                        <p>Now let vs paſſe ouer to the Lies which are giuen vpon the negatiue, whether they bee lawfull, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maye bee turned backe or no: as if one ſhoulde ſaie of mee, that in ſome matter of armes or fighting I did not my duetie, and I ſhoulde aunſwere him wyth the lie, the ſame ſhall bee a moſt lawfull aunſwere: for that in that ſpeech, that I had not doone my duetie, hee putteth on my backe no ſmall burthen of infamie, wherein it ſhall bee moſt lawfull and conuenient that I ſhoulde diſcharge my ſelfe with the lye, and heere the repulſe of an iniurie beeing the lye, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption beeing in my fauour, and that a man muſt <pb facs="tcp:11283:89"/> not preſume of another, but that hee doeth his duetie in all reſpectes, whoſoeuer goeth about to giue mee that blame, to him it appertaineth to bee eſteemed Challenger. But if one ſaie that hee hath not fayled in his loyaltie to his Lorde, and I ſhoulde aunſwere him that hee lyeth, hee maye ſaie vnto mee, thou lyeſt in that thou ſayeſt I lye, and with great reſon it maye bee ſayde, hauing aunſwered mee ſo, for hee not dooing iniurie vnto anie bodie with thoſe wordes, nor anie man ought to preſume that another ſhoulde bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall, that with the lye which I giue him, I doo not defende my ſelfe nor anie other of anie iniurie, but go about to outrage him, when hee maye lawfully returne backe that lye, and I come directly to bee demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, and ſo conſequentlye muſte become Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>Now it reſteth that wee ſhewe vnto you the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe caſes, in which in euerie and the ſelfe ſame quarrell, both vppon the affirmation and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you maye giue the lye, that neither of the one ſide nor the other there is anie meanes or waie lefte to giue them the repulſe, and it is thus.</p>
                        <p>Two Gentlemen or Caualiers are brought to the ſteccata to fight, there are weapons preſented vnto them, vppon the which they reaſon and debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues whether they be to bee refuſed or no, ſo long that the daie is paſſed without comming to the battaile or fight, there dooth ariſe a queſtion heerevpon amongeſt them, whether they bee refuſed or no.</p>
                        <p>This man whoſoeuer hee bee ſayth, that wyth reaſon they might bee refuſed, doeth charge him <pb facs="tcp:11283:90"/> that brought them, and hee who ſayth that they maye not be refuſed in reaſon, chargeth him that refuſeth to fight with them, and therefore the taske being giuen as well on the affirmatiue as negatiue, the lie may accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bee giuen, and no more the affirmatiue than the negatiue may it be wreſted or ſent backe, being both in the one and in the other manner giuen for repulſe, and not of anie iniurie. And thus much maye ſuffice to bee ſpoken of this ſubiect, ſeeing that of the other manner of Lies, how they ought to be giuen, &amp; which of them may be wreaſted, and which not, therby appeareth that they are fully demonſtrated which are lawfull. &amp; thoſe knowen, it followeth conſequently to knowe who ought to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted chalenger. And ſo (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) we finde that almoſt we haue diſpatched this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no leſſe vneaſie (as it is ſayd before) to be handled &amp; vnderſtood, than neceſſary to be knowen of all caualiers and Gentlemen.</p>

The redoubled I call thoſe, when one is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue ſaide to his aduerſarie the ſelfe ſame wordes of outrage, but doth ioyne thereto an other or more, as if I ſhould ſay to another, that he is a falſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie maker, and he ſhould ſay to me I am ſo, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide withall: vpon theſe cauſes the writers of Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo moue manye queſtions, whither vpon them there ſhould be any fighting or no: and if they ſhould fight which ſhould be Challenger and which the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: heerein to ſhew you that which I think, before I will ſpeake thereof any thing at all, I do adiudge him an ill brought vp gentlemen, who feeleth himſelf to be charged with any blot of infamy, ſhall not be as wel at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue to take away that, as to ſeek with like or greter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to ſlaunder his aduerſarie, that he ought with a lye put backe that which ſhalbe ſpoken to him, rather then either reply the ſame, or multiplie any other in words: and ſo doing, two commodities will followe him, the one that with the lye he ſhall charge his enemye with that dutie to bee Challenger: the other that hee ſhall make himſelfe knowne a perſon farre from iniurious intention. But if the caſe happen in any of the formes aforeſaid, there is ſomewhat to be marked how a man muſt be haue himſelfe therein. I ſay therfore when one calleth me traitor, and I ſay thou art a traitor, &amp; do not thereto only ioyn any word that hath not the force of the lye, no combat is to follow:<note place="margin">An iniurie not thought.</note> and if hee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye the ſame iniurie many other times, it ſhalbe as <pb facs="tcp:11283:91"/> much as if an iniury once repulſed, there is no more repulſe to be ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>But if it ſhould be anſwered, thou lyeſt that ſayeſt I am a traitor, for that thou art the traitor: I doe not ſee wherefore the combate ſhould not followe heere, for with theſe words I haue diſcharged my ſelfe with that he charged me, and laide vpon him the ſlaunder of traitor, which is that I ſend back the iniurie done to me, and iniurie him with the repulſe thereof, binding him to his proofe: and although he ſhould replye, but thou lyeſt thy ſelfe that I am the traitor, for all this hee is not diſcharged, but anſwered to that iniurye that I gaue him: and becauſe the lye was giuen of me in time, it will haue the greater reaſon, and is required at his hand to proue the truth of his ſpeech: but hauing called me traitor, I ſhould anſwere him, thou art the traitor, and hee afterwarde ſubioyne thou lyeſt: now the caſe of Challenger will come vpon me, becauſe he dooth not ſtaye himſelfe vpon the firſte iniurye, but anſwereth to that I ſaide to him: and now to me there remaineth no more meanes to binde him to the proofe, beeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie with the lye giuen me made Challenger. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be ſaide, that that anſwere, thou art the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, hath ſo much the force of a repulſe, as of an iniury: for that the repulſe ſtandeth in the negatiue, and if the negatiue haue not the force of a lye, it chargeth not: and that being anſwered Traitor, the iniurie with a lye may be put back lawfullie, that although it be true, that an iniurie once wreſted will not permit any more wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: it is to be vnderſtoode, that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the wreſting &amp; repulſe: with the wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, <pb facs="tcp:11283:91"/> I ſay to thee that thou ſaieſt of me, but with the repulſe I giue thee not that blame that thou giueſt me, but onely doe free my ſelfe thereof, charging thee with no blame at all, but with the dutie to prooue that thou haſt ſaide, and that that which I ſay ſhould be ſo: if one ſhould ſay that I am a theefe, and I ſhould anſwere him that he lyeth, this ſhalbe tearmed iniurie, and not wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but repelled: and if to one of theſe lyes which we haue ſhewed before, which haue the nature of an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, an anſwere ſhould be made to them by another lie, this ſhalbe called wreſting. And this is a true reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo to be approued and followed according to the ſtile and order of Gentlemen and Caualiers. And that which I haue ſaide of rewarded iniuries, I ſaye the ſame of the redoubled, that hee muſt not bee tearmed Challenger by the multiplication of iniuries, but muſt be ruled by the lye, hauing ſaide to you before that about queſtion of words, the proofe of the lawes are appointed to the iniuryer, and not to the iniured: true it is, that when neither of the one ſide nor the other the lye is, hee ſhall not remayne without ſome blame to whome the ſame was firſte ſpoken, how manye or great ſoeuer they be.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen were wont to ſend a gloue for a defie, and with fierce wordes did diſpatch the ſame, when they came vnto the fight: for it was not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them eſteemed peraduenture any aduantage to bee Defendant, not vſing that (I cannot tell what to tearme it) wittie or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling kinde in election of Armes,<note place="margin">The election of Armes is verie cauelling.</note> which in theſe our daies are accuſtomed. Afterward came the cuſtome of ſending of Cartelles, in which manner of proceeding there was much difficultie and newneſſe, and diuerſe offences to bee carried. Laſtly, the publication is taken vp, the which is more ſure and more readie, chiefely the Lordes hauing ſeene the multiplication of quarrelles, haue prouided that in their ſtates no cartels maye bee preſented, which beeing ſo effectually brought to paſſe that euerie one of them doth vſe it, it leaueth no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpeake many wordes vpon it: Thus much I ſaie, that as Cartels are publiſhed, &amp; in aſſurance thereof the daie intimated and notified, then there is no place lefte of excuſe or alledging of ignorance. And by this means all manner of hiding the matter, and all other euaſions that might haue beene vſed in the time of appreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are cleane taken awaie.</p>
                        <p>This I ſhal ſaie more, which I haue touched before ſpeaking of the fooliſh lies, that when anie man whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <pb facs="tcp:11283:95"/> ſhall giue me a lie preſent, and without aduantage of weapons or of men, if then I do not anſwere him, to come afterward to publiſh a Cartell with the Lie, I can not hold my ſelfe ſatisfied: for not being charged with out anie ſuperſticerie, and I not anſwering the ſame, &amp; going about a farre of to anſwere him, I do in a manner confeſſe that I am not a man to ſtand face to face wyth him, and thus by my deeds conſent that he is ſuperiour to mee, howe ſhall I by writing equall my ſelfe to him, and my opinion is, that ſuch a lye ſhall neuer be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lawfull. Truth it is, if I doo not aunſwere preſently the iniurious wordes, I am not of opinion that therfore another time I ſhal be barred to make my anſwer to the ſame, and to him that gaue them mee, onely this, that I muſt ſo holde the ſame, that thereby I take not any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage in the doing of it. And if one ſhall bee ſo lame or weake, that anſwering it is ſeene manifeſtlye that the other without anie paine may hurt or offend him: to this man it may bee lawfull to ſeeke aſſured meanes to aunſwere. And ſo in all matters of iniurie which are committed with ſuperſticerie, although they be ſpoken to a mannes face, it is a thing cleere, that aunſwering by writing, and by the waie of publication, is an anſwering to one moſt legitiuely, and when the other with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperſticerie ſhould aunſwere him it, that anſwere ſhall alſo be lawfull.</p>

In which caſe there is nothing to ſay, but that it is neceſſarie before wee paſſe anie further, that ſuch difficulties bee made cleere, and the meane to cleer them is, that the gentlemen ſubmit themſelues to the iudgement of ſome prince or noble man tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <pb facs="tcp:11283:97"/> on both partes, and choſen of both the parties, and accordingly as they do cenſure it, ſo the quarrell to be left or followed. And be it that the one wil not accept the propoſed iudgment, the opinion of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſhall bee of him, if he were Challenger, that the oppoſitions made were iuſtly made to him, and if he were Defendant, that hee had an vniuſt quarrell to defend. And when the Challenger ſhould be the man that ſhoulde refuſe the iudgement, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant remaineth nought elſe to doo, but to ſtand vpon it firmely: truely yet when the Defendant ſhall auoid the determination, then it appertaineth to the Challenger to proceede further, hauing ſhewed or ſent him the letters patents or of the fielde, hee hath more to do, he muſt ſend them him, &amp; notifie them, requiring him that either hee accept the one, or ſend backe the others, or elſe let him chooſe one of them with proteſtation that if hee do not accept the ſame, or refuſe to ſend, hee doeth cauſe him to vnderſtand that ſhe ſhall auoide it, and is to accept ſuch an offer, ſpecifieng one of his patents and letters, and that in conuenient time hee ſhall finde him in that place or field to make an end with his weapon of the quarrel if hee ſhall bee there, otherwiſe with all diſdaine and contumacie hee ſhall proceede to his infamie, wyth thoſe clauſes which ſhall bee neceſſarie for ſuch an effect.

And this remedie is lawfull to be vſed when the Defendant doth flie the iudgement thereof, that the ſame ſhoulde be choſen of both the parties by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon accord: for when the quarrell is conteſted and cleere, no matter now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be determined on, for there remaining anie one Article to be determined on, they cannot binde another to accept it, nor to ſend patents or letters of the fielde, for that hath his time and place when all controuerſie is paſt, and that done, then there reſteth nothing but to come to blowes.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His doubt is often moued by them that write of this matter, concerning which Gentlemen are reſolued, that for their Prince and Soueraigne they will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hazard their liues euen into greateſt daungers, but their honour will they not in anie caſe ſuffer to be ſpotted with diſgrace or cowardiſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are growen into this cuſtome, that beeing challenged to the combate, or vnderſtanding or perceiuing that others meane to challenge them, or elſe intending and reſolued wyth themſelues to <pb facs="tcp:11283:98"/> challenge others, they will retire into ſome ſecrete place, where it ſhall not conſiſt onely in theyr Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces power to forbidde, or ſtaie them from it, and ſo laying aſide all reſpect either of their Princes fauour or loſſe of goods, or banniſhment from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, they take the combate in hande. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhoulde doo otherwiſe amongſt men profeſsing Armes, ſhoulde bee iudged to haue greatly empay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his credit and reputation, and diſhonoured him ſelfe in high degree.</p>
                        <p>Alſo he ſhould bee eſteemed vnworthie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with Gentlemen, and if chance he ſhould chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge anie man afterward, he might deſeruedly bee repulſed, &amp; lawfully. Which manner and order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by long cuſtome, and vniuerſally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and helde for ſterling among knightes and Gentlemen of all ſortes, I thinke it needles heere to trouble myſelfe with aunſwering all ſuch friuolous obiections as diuerſe make that haue written of this ſubiect whereof ſome alleadge the ancient deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of warre, wherein it was not lawfull for anie ſouldier to combate againſt the commandement or without ſpeciall leaue of the Generall: for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not the difference of the caſes, which is greate, ſeeing it is another matter to be in an armie, where a man is bound to attend to eſpeciall enterpriſes, and to bee idle at home. Beſides this, there is alſo muche difference betweene the defiances vſed in auncient times, and oures, which being in no vſe or cuſtome, &amp; ſcarſe knowen vnto the Romanes, how could they make any lawes or take any order concerning them?</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:98"/>Furthermore, thoſe Gentlemen or Souldiers that in ancient time challenged one another to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, beeing of contrarye armies, and enemie one to the other, (whom theſe writers alleadge againſt vs) were induced to ſeeke the tryall of armes, for one of theſe two cauſes: either for that the deciſion of the whole warre was agreed vpon by both parties, to be committed to ſome fewe of eche armie, as it fell out when the <hi>Horatij</hi> and <hi>Curatij</hi> tried their valour for the whole armies: and in this caſe it is moſt neceſſarye that the election of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>batants ſhould apertain to the ſuperiors &amp; cheefe gouernours: neither can it by any reaſon be lawful for eche one to take any ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe in hand that is willing to doe it, or elſe for profe of their valour: in which caſe alſo no Souldier ought to goe to the combate without licence, neither doth any burthen or charge remaine vpon him, if he deny the combate, for that hee is to vſe his valour in that warre not according to his owne pleaſure, but his vnto whome hee hath ſworne his ſeruice and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without any reſpect of particular intereſt: yet it may ſo fall out, that a Souldier being burdened with ſome eſpeciall quarrell concerning his reputation, ought ſo much to regarde the ſame, that he ought to abandon both the armye, his countrie and naturall Prince, rather then to ſuffer it to paſſe vnanſwered. Concerning which point, I will ſay as much as I can preſently call to remembrance.</p>
                        <p>True it is, that if there riſe any quarrell betweene two gentlemen of two aduerſary armies, they ought not either to challenge, or anſwere a challenge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authoritie of their Generall: for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb facs="tcp:11283:99"/> his leaue, it is not lawful for any man to haue any intelligence or dealings whatſoeuer, with any in the enemies Campe: but if that the quarrell were ſuch, that either of the parties ſhould be diſhonored either by delaying the challenge, or not aunſwering the ſame, then ought he whoſe honor and reputation is in danger of ſtaine, to enlarge himſelfe as much as in him lyeth, from that ſubiection hee is in, and bring himſelfe into the waye whether the ſafegarde of his honor inuiteth him. Inſomuch that among Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men this opinion is currant, that if a man were in ſome Cittie beſiedged by the enemie, and could not obtaine leaue of the Gouernour to come foorth, hee ought to leape ouer the walles, to goe and defend his honor. Yet will I not deny, but that if a mans country or naturall Prince ſhould be intereſſed in the matter, he ought to haue a reſpect both of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and eſpecially when a great parte of the quarrel ſhould concerne either his Countrie or Prince: for that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maner of proceeding therin, ought to be platted by their counſaile and aduiſe. But in all other caſes, when the matter onely concerneth a mans own intereſt, then ought not any gentleman be backward in challenging, or anſwering the challenger: and in no caſe either vpon commaundement, or vpon any penaunce whatſoeuer, refuſe the combat.</p>
                        <p>Neither according to my ſimple conceite, ought any prince to look for any thing at his ſubiects hands that may empaire their reputation, or woorke their diſhonour.</p>

And for adulterie ought a man to combate, not as to reuenge the wrong done to one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in regarde of all, conſidering how holye and religious a bond matrimonie is, being a lawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction inſtituted and ordained by God, to the end that man and woman therein ſhould not as two, but one perſon, liue together in ſuch manner, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except death only might ſeperate and diſioyn them. Wherfore perpending the dignitie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines hereof, and how that by adulterie this deuine ordinance and inſtitution is violated, matrimonyall <pb facs="tcp:11283:100"/> coniunction infringed, and lawfull procreation cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, euerye Gentleman ought to vndertake the combate, not ſo muche to reuenge himſelfe, or his freends, or to thaſtice or puniſhe the offenders, as to preſerue and keepe from violence a bond ſo ſacred and inuiolable, with ſure hope, that God, who (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith) will iudge the Adulterer, will by means thereof giue moſt ſeuere iudgement.</p>
                        <p>In like manner, if ſome man haue miſ-behaued himſelfe in any matter concerning his prince or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, each Gentleman ought to thinke, how that God hath ordained and authoriſed Princes to be aboue vs, to the ende that vnder him they may as his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and officers gouerne vs his humble flocke, how that nothing beeing more gratefull and acceptable vnto God, then good gouernment among men (who aſſembled together, and liuing vnder the ſame lawes, beare themſelues orderly, gouerning their liues and manners aright) we are not ſo much bound in dutie towardes any, as towards them that are as it were lieutenantes vnto almightie God in earth, for ſo I call our princes and gouernors: and towards that aſſemblie &amp; congregation of mankind, vnder whoſe lawes we are borne and bred, I meane our Countrie, and how that no greter wickednes can be committed than for a man to rebel againſt him whom God hath ordained Lord and gouernor ouer him, or to wrong him vnto whome he hath giuen his faith, or to betray that citie vnto which hee is both for his liuing, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp, &amp; many benefits beſides infinitly beholding. In reſpecte whereof, I ſaie each Gentleman hauing
<pb facs="tcp:11283:101"/> conſidered and weighed all this, ought as a publique plague, and not as a particular enemie, to perſecute him that committeth any of theſe odious exceſſes: calling him to the triall of the ſwoorde, confidentlye hoping and truſting with aſſured faith, that God will chaſtice and puniſh him that hath ſo greeuouſlye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended both him and his people, violating his ſacred ordinances and conſtitutions. And for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if ſome man haue committed murder, hee that will combate with him, muſt not doe it to this ende, onely to wreake the death of him that is murdered, in reſpect that he was his freend or kinſeman, but he ought to call to minde what a noble and excellent creature man is, who being taken away and brought to naught by murder or ſlaughter, the faireſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableſt woorke which almightie God hath framed, is marred, and ſpoiled. Inſomuch that whoſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth murder, dooth diſſolue and breake the moſt perfect peece of woorke that the creator of heauen and earth hath made, and defaceth the image and likenes of God. And for that God in his ſacred law ordeined, that man-ſlayers ſhould be carryed from his alter and put to death, the partie that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, knowing how greatly his diuine maieſtie is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with this ſinne, ought not to vndertake the combate, becauſe he would kill him, but becauſe hee might be as it were, the miniſter to execute Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine pleaſure, and moſt holy commaundement.</p>
                        <p>By theſe examples maye a Gentleman perceiue what ought to be doone in all other caſes, ſo that it ſhall be needles for men to ſeeke examples for eache <pb facs="tcp:11283:101"/> offence, troubling both my ſelfe and the Reader. In the meane time, take this by the way, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I haue heere ſaide of the Challenger, is alſo in the ſame manner to be vnderſtoode of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: inſomuch that both the one and the other ought to regarde the preſeruation of their honour and innocencie by iuſt meanes: the one neuer chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging but with iuſt cauſe and vpright meaning, and the other neuer accepting any challenge, vnleſſe hee know himſelfe to be guiltles: and in ſuch ſorte, that he may take it with a good conſcience, as to doe or performe any action that concerneth his honor, to liue and dye in defence thereof. For, as it is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe any diſhonorable act, ſo is it more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and opprobrious to maintain the ſame, and ſtand in defence of it.</p>
                        <p>And againe, a man finding himſelfe innocent and wrongfully diſhonored, ought not to feare any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but to venter his life at all times, for the righting either of priuate or publique wronges: in all things, conſiderations, and circumſtances, hauing a ſpeciall regarde vnto iuſtice. For God giueth right vnto him that is iuſt, and ouerthroweth the vniuſt: whoſoeuer therefore ſhall take armes for iuſtice to repell vniuſt iniuries, may be aſſured to preuaile, and with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſmaied courage goe about what he vndertaketh.</p>

                        <head>OF INIVRIE, OF the Charge, and of the ſhame.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas I haue before ſufficientlye intreated vppon the qualitie of Lyes, and ſhewed the nature of them to bee to returne iniuries, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſome wyll meruaile why I ſhould againe ſpeak thereof in this place, ſeeing that the iniurie muſt needes be before any returne, which (though I confeſſe) bee out of order to reduce it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this title, yet in diuerſe reſpects I haue bene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereunto, as namely, for that I finde a verie ill cuſtome generally followed in quarrelles, where by contempt of right courſe and law it ſelfe, Gentlemen are raſhly carryed to take weapons in hand, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering firſt if it bee a lawful quarrell, or ſuch as may deſerue a Combat, nor doo they euer deſire to bee directed by an orderly proceeding. But Gentlemen of diſcretion ought firſt before they enter into armes rightly to examine the quality of their quarel, if it be worthie the proofe by weapons, and by this meanes <pb facs="tcp:11283:102"/> make a right introduction to the truth, ſo as men bee not raſhly lead on to the ſlaughter. Again, the ground of all quarrels betwixte Gentlemen is this, that they thinke themſelues iniuried or charged, whereof my purpoſe is chiefly to intreate, ſo farre forth as I ſhall thinke it needfull.</p>
                        <p>To beginne then with iniurie,<note place="margin">Iniury.</note> it is nothing elſe but a thing done without reaſon, as (as we vſe to ſay) wrongfully.<note place="margin">Charge.</note> And Charge is no other but an inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man to returne, or to prooue or reproue anie thing alledged, which is ſo tearmed by this name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the lawiers affirme, that the charge of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reſteth on the Challenger.<note place="margin">He that is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the man charged ought to be the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and touching theſe two wordes, it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that ſometime both iniurie and charge are at one time done, and ſometime charge without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, and a man maye alſo iniurie and not charge. Touching the firſt thus it is, I am charged by one with an offence I neuer committed, wherin he doth me iniurie,<note place="margin">Iniury charge.</note> becauſe hee doth vnlawfully ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame, me, and then laieth the charge on me, in that he forceth mee to ſeeke to returne the iniurie, and make anſwere to his opprobrious wordes, vnleſſe I would ſuffer my ſelfe to be ſhamed.<note place="margin">Charge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iniurie.</note> Whereupon I giue him the lie, and ſo diſcharge my ſelfe and come to charge him, which ſetteth me free, &amp; bindeth him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his wordes, which is as much as to vrge him to challenge. Wherefrom we are to note, that I onely charge him without iniuring, becauſe my anſwere is but reaſonable, and ſo the charge reſteth on him, as I <pb facs="tcp:11283:103"/> ſayd before. Iniurie without charge is of two ſortes, viz. of wordes and of deedes. Of wordes thus, if one man ſhould ſpeak anie thing of another, which were manifeſtly knowen to bee falſe, to this he ſhould not bee bound to aunſwere, becauſe the firſt without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie returne woulde bee accounted a falſe accuſer and a lyer: and in mine opinion, it is a more honourable reputation for a man to bee ſilent in ſuch a caſe, than by aunſwering to ſeeme to make any account of the wordes: as a noble worthie man ſayde vnto a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that had ſlaundered him, that hee would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holde him a friende nor an enemie, not yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere his wordes, reckning him vnworthie to bee wel ſpoken off by an honeſt man, and too baſe a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for a man to ſpeake euill off. But if in caſe of ſuch ſhamefull and falſe wordes, a man ſhoulde bee vrged and giue the lie, it is more than is requiſite, as a thing whereof a quarrell ought not to be taken, for quarrels are to teſtifie a truth, and where that is once manifeſt, the quarrell is not required.</p>
                        <p>Iniurie by deeds without charge is, when a man by aduantage or ſuch lyke meanes offereth a wrong, and it is euident that ſuch a facte was villanouſlye doone, and this iniurie I account doone without charge, in ſuch lyke ſorte as that was by wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that if hee that is iniuried woulde demaunde the other a reaſon of his villanie, howe coulde he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe maintaine it vnleſſe by alleadging that the other had taken aduauntage of him, or doone him ſome wrong. And if this bee ſo, what needeth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe? But perhappes ſome man wyll aske me <pb facs="tcp:11283:103"/> if in this caſe hee ſhoulde put vp this iniurie without reuenge? To whome I aunſwere, that Combat was ordayned for iuſtifieng of a truth,<note place="margin">Combat not ordayned for reuenge.</note> and not to laye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a waie for one man to reuenge him of another, for the puniſhment of ſuche thinges reſteth in the Prince for the maintenance of peace in the realme, which if it ſhoulde bee ſeuerely executed, no doubt but there woulde bee fewer quarrelles by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. And in troth, the offence is the greater in this Realme, where wee knowe God, and heare his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell dailie preached, which expreſlie forbiddeth manſlaughter: by howe much that hee that killeth maketh a maſſacre of the verie true image of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore we ought onelye to feare, reuerence, and obey him, and not follow our owne vaine appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which carrie vs headlong into vtter ruine and deſtruction. But to returne to reuenge, he that needs will followe it, ought to take another courſe then combate, albeit many no doubt will aduiſe a man to returne like for like, which in no caſe I would not wiſh ſhould be followed. But many perhaps that are rather ledde by an ill cuſtome than reaſon, wil won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this I haue alreadie alleadged, becauſe heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will alſo affirme, that where an iniurie is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye doone, not onelye the iniuried is free of the charge, but the iniurier reſteth wyth the ſhame, for in matters of chiualrie, where a man committeth no ſhamefull, diſhonourable, or vile facte, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truely bee ſayde to haue doone vnlyke a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: and mee thinketh it an vnpoſsible thing <pb facs="tcp:11283:104"/> to auoide receiuing iniurie from another, therefore when anie thing happeneth which a man cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, it ought to be iudged ſhamefull. For a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing is, where a man committeth villanie which was in his power not to haue done:<note place="margin">From what a man ought to refrayne.</note> as for example, I haue power in my ſelfe to refraine from iniuring an other, from committing wicked facts, from breaking my promiſe, from committing treaſon, which things if I obſerue not, I bring vpon my ſelf the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and ſhame that poſſibly anie man may bring on himſelfe: his then ought the ſhame to be that hath doone this beaſtly act, and not his to whome it was done. Which may be yet farther confirmed by this argument: that where a man proceedeth not lyke a Gentleman, he ſheweth a cowardly feare in himſelf, not to dare to maintaine it in equalitie againſt him whome hee ſought to haue wronged.<note place="margin">The iniurye is his who doth it</note> And touching this opinion, auncient men before vs haue ſayd, that the iniurie is not his to whome it was doone, but his who doeth it. Againe, my opinion is that in caſe of ſome former quarrell, he that doth anie diſhoneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie may be denyed the Combate, as one that hath before committed a defect, and hee that receiueth it ought (as the caſe may be) to bee receiued alwayes, ſuppoſing alwayes that this defect of him that iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is manifeſt. And I wyll not omit in this place to ſpeake of an ill cuſtome vſed nowe a daies,<note place="margin">Hee is diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill act.</note> which ought no leſſe to bee confuted by reaſon, than it is commonly followed with great affection, which is, that when a man knoweth himſelfe to haue rightly receiued the lye, by and by to auoide the proofe, hee <pb facs="tcp:11283:104"/> ſeeketh to giue the baſtonado, or ſuch lyke fact, and many times turnes his backe and runnes his waie, to the ende that hee that is iniuried may not preſently take reuenge, and in this ſort he thinketh to be valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly diſcharged, which lykewiſe the common ſorte doo verily iudge, and doo not perceiue their errour,<note place="margin">The reuenge ought to bee done honorably</note> and how groſly they are deceiued. For firſt of all, if for honour ſake I would doo anie thing, I am to doe it honourablie and lyke a Gentleman, and not villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly and lyke a traitour: nor muſt I thinke that a ſhamefull fact can grace or diſgrace me, but muſt reſt aſſured, that the charge don me by another is yet ſtill vpon me, and that I bring a greater ſhame vnto it by this diſhonourable deede. Next, if I cannot commit a more odious thing in combat than to runne away, how may I thinke to haue done honourably by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning awaie? And wherefore ſhould not hee bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of all ſorts of Gentlemen more honourable from whom I runne, than I who runne, albeit I haue done him ſome great diſgrace: for to iniurie another is no honour, and to runne awaie is a ſhame.<note place="margin">Who he is that offendeth in an ill ſorte.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will neuer be perſwaded, that a man that hath iuſtly receiued the Lie, can by anie ſuch act diſcharge himſelfe, or that hee is not bounde to prooue that whereon hee receiued the Lie, but that hee ought to bee the Challenger: and this opinion do I holde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the reaſons before alleadged, which mee think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Gentleman ought ſooner to followe, than a blinde opinion of the vulgar ſorte, which hath in it neither lawe nor reaſon. And I woulde wiſhe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen by theſe rules to examine the cauſes for <pb facs="tcp:11283:105"/> which a man intendeth to fight, &amp; firſt to vnderſtand the nature of quarrels if they deſerue Combat, or if they mare otherwiſe be anſwered than by the ſword, and not to be perſwaded by intreatie or fauour of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to agree to vnneceſſary quarrels, becauſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the offence towardes God, it is an iniurie to a man to draw him to fight that is not bound, and it is alſo a wrong to the magiſtrate before whome ſuch controuerſies ought to be decided, intruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into their office and function. Nor yet may we allowe a quarrell vppon euerie Lie, as I haue at large ſhewed in my diſcourſe of Lies: and wee maye alſo note here that a Lie lawfully giuen, is that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the charge, whereby the other is bounde to the proofe ſimply, and not to the proofe of Armes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I haue ſayde before) in ſuch a caſe where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe may bee made than by weapon, the Lye doth not onely not binde a man to the Combat, but euerie Gentleman is bound to deſiſt from the triall by Armes, and to relie on the triall by reaſon.</p>
                        <p>I muſt alſo adde heereunto, that euerie Lie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a man cannot make iuſtification by ciuill lawe, doth not yet by and by deſerue combat. For I would not haue anie thinke that there is ſuch efficacie in a Lie to binde a man to fight, as it ſeemeth ſome holde opinion, which in deede proceedeth from a corrupt vſe of certaine that haue beene before vs, who for want of vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">Duello is not neceſſarie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euerie Lie</note> without law, reaſon, or right courſe of Chiualrie, in the beginning dyd giue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to infamous perſons, to require the Combat, (as men deſirous and willing to beholde others in <pb facs="tcp:11283:105"/> fight) as if it were at the baiting of a bull, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilde beaſt, whoſe ſucceſſours imitating theyr predeceſſours, haue brought theſe thinges to this paſſe, as generallye it is holden, that whoſoeuer hee bee that receiueth the Lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bee it vppon whatſoeuer occaſion, hee is preſentlie bounde to diſcharge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thereof onely by his ſwoorde, and not by anye other meanes. Which diſorder beeing thus farre proceeded, ought no doubt to bee carefully redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that Gentlemen maye bee reduced from theyr erronious opinion by the ſelfe ſame waie and means that they fell firſt into it. And to the ende that men maye bee rightly perſwaded,<note place="margin">The Lie doth not leade a man to fight.</note> I ſaie that the Lye is not the thing that induceth fight, but the occaſion whereupon it was giuen, and if there were no proofe of the defect whereof a man is blamed, that hee can in no ſorte binde the other to fight, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde ought to bee to the qualitie of the iniurie, and not to the Lie.</p>
                        <p>But I am ſure ſome will account this opinion newly vpſtart: to whome I aunſwere, their cuſtome and opinion is farre more newe, and that mine is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee proued auncient, becauſe no law can bee found, that commandeth a man for the receiuing of the Lie to fall preſentlie to fight: but all thoſe lawes whereon the Combat hath beene graunted, haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie reiected the occaſions, amongeſt which, no mention is made of the Lie: and this is the true and auncient cuſtome approoued by the lawes of the Lombardes, and by the inſtitutions of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:106"/>And if a man ought preſently to fight vpon the Lie, it is vaine that the Lombards and other Princes after them, haue taken paines to ſet downe the particular cauſes for which a man ought to fight, and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for which it is not lawfull to fight: ſo as I conclude that in all caſes a man ought with greate iudgement and circumſpection behaue himſelfe wiſely.</p>

Againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in an honourable perſon his honor ought to be preferred before his life, if it happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to haue ſuch a defect laid againſt him, as in reſpect thereof he <pb facs="tcp:11283:106"/> were by lawe to be accounted diſhonorable, and ſhould therefore be diſgraced before the tribunall ſeate: vpon ſuch a quarrell my opinion is, that hee is not to be denied to iuſtifie himſelf by weapons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided alwaies, that hee be not able by lawe to cleere himſelfe thereof, And except a quarrell be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder one of theſe two ſortes, I doe not ſee how any man can by reaſon or with his honor, either graunt or accompanye an other to the fight.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer,<note place="margin">The dutie of gentlemen,</note> ſuch Gentlemen as doe counſaile or accompany a man, ought to be iudges of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, for vnto them it belongeth cheefely to knowe if the quarrell deſerue triall by armes or no, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ſuſpected of the defect laide againſt him, and if there be preſumption thereof. But if theſe thinges be not well iuſtified and proued, the combate ought not to be admitted, becauſe that the profe by armes being ordained, as a meanes to ſift out the truth, as in ciuile iudgement, where the proofe is reaſonable and certaine, no man can be put to torture without due information, and ſufficient witnes, much leſſe ought it to be doone in the iudgement of weapons, which perhaps may fall out to be as little to reaſon, as very doubtfull.</p>
                        <p>Againe, thoſe Gentlemen are to vnderſtand if the quarrell haue been vndertaken heretofore by any of the parties to be proued by lawe, or otherwiſe:<note place="margin">The quarrell aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed at the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile law.</note> and then whether it be proued or no, it is not lawfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to bring it to combat: beſides, they are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to conſider,<note place="margin">Ciuile Proofe.</note> if it may be iuſtified by any other meanes or no. And if in caſe it may be done by law, <pb facs="tcp:11283:107"/> weapons are not to be allowed: for if by ciuile cauſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies are remitted from one iudge to another, as actions more belonging to one then to another, much rather is the like to bee doone, from the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of armes, to ciuile law, ſeeing the inequality is much the greater:<note place="margin">An oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> and vpon theſe two laſt articles theſe gentlemen ought to take oath of him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the fielde, and without iuſtification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there is no reaſon to graunt it to any man: which thing is ſo muche the more to bee obſerued, by how much it is a common caſe, that men are moued to fight vpon ſuch quarrels as might be ended by ciuile law, and whoſoeuer is once challenged the fielde, it is accompted a ſhame for him to refuſe it in which caſe the vulgare opinion is, that it is not manlynes in a gentleman to ſtand vpon reaſons.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if happilie in cartels there be any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, that notwithſtanding he could proue his intent by ciuile teſtimony, yet he intendeth to doe it by weapons, this I ſay is a very great abuſe, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ought to take oath of infamy, that is, that they doe not require the fielde maliciouſlye, or with a minde to infame another, but onely for proofe of the truth, and this oath hath beene ordeined and put in practiſe of men long agoe. And we muſt alſo adde, that thoſe gentlemen ought fullye to bee ſatisfied by oath, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that demaund the fielde, if that which they pronounce, be their true quarrell, becauſe many times ſome men will not ſtick to determine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues one pretence of their fight, &amp; yet make known to the world another, which abuſes gentlemen ought diligently to take heed of, becauſe many times ſuch <pb facs="tcp:11283:107"/> malice hath been diſcouered. Touching all ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whereon anye controuerſie or diſſencion maye growe, men ought ſpecially to beware, not to be ſelf-willed, but are rather to take counſail and aduiſe both of their freends and experienced men, and if there be cauſe to iudge this courſe neceſſarie in anye mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it ought cheefelye to bee in ſuch caſes, wherein a mans life and honour is touched, for we ſee that euen the wiſeſt ſorte to ſtudy and endeuour by all meanes poſſible to furniſh themſelues with men experienced and ſeene in chiualrye and armes, that they maye bee counſailed and aduiſed by them, and may in ſuch ſort wiſh them to the field, as may beſt ſtand with reaſon, which office may onely be executed by learned men and gentlemen, wherof the firſt are tearmed counſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and the ſecond Padrini:<note place="margin">Padrini, are thoſe that are choſen by the combators on either ſide.</note> but if happily one man be ſeen in both, hee maye very well ſuffice to execute both offices, but becauſe the charge conſiſteth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally on the Padrini, we will ſpeak ſomwhat of them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then my opinion is, that they were ſo called, either becauſe ſuch gentlemen as had remitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto them, ought to account of them as their fathers, or els that this mutation of letters is deriued from the latine, which termeth thoſe patrones,<note place="margin">Patrones, Padrini.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, much more ought to be to them that ſpeake for them, which as it is reaſonable, ſo is it to be obſerued for the better conſeruation of the right vſe of chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to the end euery man may freely execute his function, which thing I note, becauſe it happeneth ſometimes, that ſuch men take vpon them to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drini, who doe it more to take holde of a newe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, then for the defence of their gentilitie.

                        <p>Firſte therefore it is to bee vnderſtoode, that the wiſedome and diſcretion of a man, is as great a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as his magnanimitie and courage, which are ſo much the greater vertues, by how much they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with wiſedome: for without them a man is not to be accounted valiant, but rather furious nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is hee valiant that raſhly and without aduiſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth himſelfe in great matters, or endaungereth himſelfe moſt: but hee that aduiſedly behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in actions belonging to a gentleman, and where <pb facs="tcp:11283:109"/> a publique benefite or his owne honor requireth it, doth not retire himſelfe from danger: for (as a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher well ſaith) neither is hee valiant that is afraide of euery bugge, nor yet he that doth not temper his feares.</p>
                        <p>Againe, as the courage of the minde imboldeneth a man to aſſault his enemy, ſo wiſedom teacheth him likewiſe how to defend himſelfe: ſo as I will neuer holde him couragious, that will be led to fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient weapons of defence. And albeit the common ſorte thinke the ſingle Rapier in the ſhirte, or the poniard or ſuch like weapons, wherein there is a manifeſt iudgement of death to one, moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neuertheles I am not of that opinion, nor will I account them that enter the combate in ſuch ſorte more honorable, then wilde beaſtes that wilfullye run vpon their own death.</p>
                        <p>And touching ſuch as think it an honorable thing not onely not to eſteme their life, but voluntarilye to runne on their death, I will account their life at a very lowe and baſe price, ſeing they themſelues ſet no greater reckoning on it.</p>
                        <p>It is helde a moſt ſhamefull matter, if when the cuſtodie of a Caſtell ſhall be committed to a man, hee ſhall without licence forſake it: and ſhall wee that haue our liues lente vs in keeping from our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, haue no reſpect of ſo goodly a receptacle of our ſoules, but wilfully deſtroye it, making our ſelues as it were, rebels vnto God, and ſo bring both bodye and ſoule to perdition?</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if a Gentleman goe to the warres, wee
<pb facs="tcp:11283:109"/> ſee him ſo eſteemed of as hee is in ſhewe of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: and therefore I ſee no cauſe at all that a man ſhould in publique matters ſeeke to be well armed, and in priuate quarrelles come naked: and me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man ſhould at all times and in all places ſhewe him ſelfe valiant and deſire the victorye: which if it be granted, they ſhould likewiſe in al mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moment prepare themſelues armed.</p>
                        <p>And if Gentlemen will haue this reſpect of curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie towarde their enemie, as to giue him weapons wherewith he may end the controuerſie: I thinke it reaſon they ſhould be ſuch as may arm him, and not burden him.</p>
                        <p>The dutie of euerye Gentleman, is to temper his courage with wiſedome, that it may be knowne, that neither he ſetteth ſo highlye by his life, that for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of it, he will commit any vile fact, nor yet that he ſo ſlightlye regardeth it, as that without iuſt cauſe he will depriue himſelfe thereof: albeit I doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a diſhonourable act, to come armed like a man at armes, if the weapons be ſuch as belong to a Gentleman, and hurt not a man priuilie.</p>
                        <p>Again, I would that armes ſhould inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently be vſed, and that a man ſhould not then enter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, when the time is for him to leaue: and aboue al, that the weapons of defence, were both weapons of armes and warre: and if ſo be a man would fight with weapons only of defence, the gentlemen ſhould in no caſe admit it, but that they ſhould fight like gentlemen, as it hath been many times done.</p>
                        <p>Touching the choice of your weapons, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:11283:110"/> inequalitie of them,<note place="margin">The aduantage of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</note> and the imperfections of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the Defendant hath great aduantage, and it is not without iuſt cauſe, for ſeeing hee is both accuſed and conſtrained to fight, it is great reaſon that hee ſhould haue all the honeſt fauour that might be, and it is no little honor to him that in caſe he onely be not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, hee is accounted the vanquiſher: where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, the Challenger is to ouercome, vnles hee will altogither looſe the quarrell, whereof there is great reaſon, becauſe to the one it appertaineth to prooue, and to the other it is ſufficient onely to defend.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe, it is as great a fauour that hee hath to chooſe the weapons, which is alſo very meete, for if a man chooſe to call me to fight, the election of the weapons is mine.</p>
                        <p>In this choic it is certain, that there is not the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giuen, as is thought: for this parte alſo, as all other partes of duello is grounded vpon reaſon, and if wee will be nyce to ſee how a man is authoriſed to make the choyce, wiſe men are of opinion, that gentlemen ſhould receiue their ſentence of weapons from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iudgement, if in caſe the iuſtification cannot by other meanes be made:<note place="margin">How to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</note> and if they will haue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of that, it is neceſſary that they abandon all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and deceite, which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Lyon and the Foxe, and farre from the nature of man.</p>
                        <p>Now if theſe things ſhould in the whole courſe of our life be helde and perfourmed, much more ſhould they be deſired in the ſifting out of a truth, and in the direction of iudgement.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:110"/>And touching violence, me thinkes the law hath well prouided, by giuing the aduantage of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to the Defendant, which if it were not ſo, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie naughty man would embolden himſelfe to make wrong accuſations, and vrge euerie man of leſſe ſtrength to fight, perſwading himſelfe to be able to beate him downe to the ground. But ſeeing the law hath ſo well prouided againſt this, ſeeing that deceit (as the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> likewiſe affirmeth) is worthie of much hatred, it is a commendable thing that it is ſo. For in the choiſe of weapons, it belongeth to vs to make ſome lawe for the Defendant, which ſhould be ſuch, as he ſhould not vſe anie deceit in, nor graunt ſuch wepons as fit not with the diſpoſition of a mans bodie. For albeit a man maie ſale that wee are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apt in all exerciſes to vſe both handes, yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that vſe dooth ouercome nature, to make vs right or left handed. And therfore if I ſhall be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to be right handed, I cannot force my aduerſarie to fight with a weapon for the lefte hande, ſeeing the diſpoſition of my bodie is not ſuch. And if I haue no defect in my arme, or my thighe, or legge, I cannot come to fight with vambraces or ſuch lyke harneis, for thoſe partes, which hinder the bending of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, or of the knee, for this is an apparent deceit and ought to bee refuſed in the Combat, and the Padrini ought not to admit ſuch weapons.</p>
                        <p>If in caſe I be lame or hurt in one of mine armes, or my hands, or want an eie, I may verie wel appoint my enemie ſuch weapons as maie in lyke ſorte bind his legge, his arme, or his hand, or that may hide one
<pb facs="tcp:11283:111"/> of his eies, but yet if he bee lame of one arme, I maye ſure appoint him ſuch armour as may hinder the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is ſound.</p>
                        <p>And to conclude, if it be lawfull for me to appoint ſuch weapon or armour to mine enemie as may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in the ſame ſort that I am hindred, yet I muſt not hinder him vnleſſe my ſelfe be alſo hindered: as thus, If I be blinde of my right eie, and he of his left, I muſt not therefore alſo hinder his right eie, for this is not to make equalitie of my wants, but to take his whole ſight from him.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe a right handed or left handed man, or a man weakned or maimed ſo of his hand as he cannot well cloſe it, or that wanteth a finger, whereby hee is not able to holde his weapon in his hand, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is not to be conſtrained to fight with his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hand, but may lawfully and iuſtly denie the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, which is alſo to bee vnderſtoode of all other members and lims, ſo as it is requiſite that all things be guided with reaſon and iudgement for both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it doo not appeare that that which is done, is done for reuenge or to infame another, but onely for the iuſtifieng of the truth.</p>

But if any of them go out of the liſts, he is become priſoner: if his horſe be wounded or ſlaine, or if anie part of his armour breake, he is not to be ſupplied. And if he let fall his weapon out of his hand, it is lawfull for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wound him vnarmed, I ſaie lawfull in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it is accounted an honour to the other to bid him take vp his weapon, and to ſtaie from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him til he haue recouered it again: albeit that in caſe the victorie ſhould afterwarde happen to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas hee might firſt ſafely haue ouercome, <pb facs="tcp:11283:112"/> he ſhoulde bee accounted a foole, and verie well ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>

But notwithſtanding, my opinion is, that <pb facs="tcp:11283:114"/> neither of them can with honour depart the liſts, but that they are both blame-worthie as diſhonourable Gentlemen, taking vpon them to fight in vniuſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, which muſt needes bee preſumed by both their loſſes, for the victorie of one cannot take awaie the loſſe of the other: wherefore in this lyke caſe, hee that would take holde of a new quarrell, ſhould not ſaye, I remit thee the firſt, but onely thou lyeſt in ſaying I am a traitour, and vpon this heereafter I will defende my ſelfe, and then if he chaunce to ouercome in this, it cannot bee ſaide that he hath loſt the other, but the preſumption ſhoulde bee fauourable on his ſide, for if his aduerſarie haue had the worſt in one, it is to bee preſumed the like in the other: but he to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth better to fight on the firſt quarrell, ſhuld not condiſcend to the ſecond, but anſwere, that hee wyll make an end of the firſt, and afterwards ſpeake of the reſt.

Impriſonment alſo is a lawful excuſe, vnles it be ſuch as a man at all times may be freed of: for Gentlemen that are to goe into the field, ought by all meanes to auoyde euery occaſion, that may hinder them from their intent, for whoſoeuer in matters of honour dooth not ſeeke all that hee can to ſalue his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or hath other reſpect at all than to his honour, <pb facs="tcp:11283:118"/> maketh a great breach of his honour: and therefore whoſoeuer ſhould procure himſelfe to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to ſtaye by his Prince, is to bee adiudged as one that procureth his owne impriſonement.</p>

And in this one caſe onely the Defendant fighting and not ouercome, doth ouercome the other. Other caſes are common both to the Challenger &amp; Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, whereof one is in killing his aduerſarie, another is, when a man yeeldeth, bee it in whatſoeuer kinde of wordes.

But if the Defendant bee the better, there is no queſtion to bee made, but hee is to bee pronounced vanquiſher, although there coulde not bee ſo full a iudgement giuen of his ouercomming, as we haue ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And if the Challenger ſhoulde bee hee that ſhoulde chaunce to haue the Defendant in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the matter coulde not ſo eaſily bee determined of. But in this caſe theyr Articles are chiefely to bee conſidered, which maye bee drawen in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as without anie adoo at all the matter maye bee reſolued. For if in them it bee expreſſed and ſette downe, that the Challenger is not to bee helde van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſher, vnleſſe hee either kill, or make the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant denie his accuſation, in this caſe hee cannot

And if the Defendant woulde renue this quarrell on anie other daie, I doo not thinke it in anie wiſe lawfull that it ſhoulde bee graunted him. And if in caſe there ſhoulde not bee anie wordes in their Articles touching this pointe, the one holding the other in his power, (as I haue ſayde before) mee thinketh hee is leſſe to bee adiudged and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to bee his priſoner than if hee had yeelded himſelfe vnto him, and ſo voluntarilie to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his priſoner, but that hee ſhoulde bee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to bee vanquiſhed and ouercome, and the vanquiſher were deuoutly and reuerently to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and honoured, as one that onely ſatisfieng and contenting himſelfe wyth the victorie, dyd not ſeeke or deſire cruelly to imbrue his handes in his enimies bloud.</p>

For by the lawe of the Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, he that was ouercome in fight, was not geuen as priſoner, nor yet pronounced infamous for euer performing any after-quarrel, but diuerſly ſentenced for that fault whereof hee was accuſed. For, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plainelye in writing, whoſoeuer accuſed for manſlaughter was ouercome, loſt one of his handes: and whoſoeuer was condemned of adultery, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to die. And touching the witneſſes, who for conſummation of their wordes did combat, the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed loſt his hand, and his other companions dyd redeem their liues by mony: ſo ſeuerely did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the iudgement of their Duello. And our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men alleadge, that becauſe this proofe is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, albeit a man ſhoulde in the Liſtes bee founde in fault worthie to receiue puniſhment, yet hee were not to ſuffer death, but a mittigation ought to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <pb facs="tcp:11283:121"/> giuing him ſome eaſier puniſhment. Which as they alleadge truelye and verie commendably, ſo is that cuſtome of theirs to bee condemned, who in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Duello cauſe galowſes to be ſet vp neere to the place, and doo immediatly hang vp the vanquiſhed. But what greater puniſhment can there be, than that which our lawes do inflict vpon the vanquiſhed, they doo not chaſten them in the purſe, nor in cutting off anie member, nor in theyr lyfe, but in that which to euerie wiſe man is more deare than all the reſt, for they depriue him of his honour, for loue whereof there is no noble mind that will not ſpend his bloud. Thoſe that iſſue vanquiſhed out of the Liſts, carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie ſo much the more ſhame, by howe much they came thether deſirous of honour, and that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one man ouercame another, for of neceſsitie, two fighting together, one muſt be the victor, &amp; (as I haue ſayde before) the Challenger not looſing doth looſe, ſo as hee is not diſhonourable for beeing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but becauſe he is accounted a badde man that would take vpon him an vniuſt quarrell, and that hee would fight againſt the truth, which hee is chiefelye bound to maintaine. And therefore weighing and conſidering the greate daunger thoſe men incurre that commit theſe things to the proofe of the ſword, Gentlemen ought to bee more ſlowe in fighting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept great occaſion vrge them, and vnleſſe they bee certaine to fight vppon iuſtice, ſo as they may haue great hope to obtaine Gods fauour in it.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I ſayd before, ſo I will here again ſay, that the chalenger that doeth not ouercome his aduerſarie in the Liſts, doeth remaine the looſer, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing proued ſo much as hee ought, and that hee may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after challenge anie: which is confirmed with this reaſon, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer prooueth not his woordes true, is to bee thought a falſe accuſer, and conſequently is regarded and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a badde man. And the lyke is alſo of euerie other man whether hee bee Challenger or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, that is ouercome by force, or made to yeelde, or denie his wordes, or runne awaie, for hee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after that time demaunde Combat nor bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it.</p>
                        <p>But I knowe ſome that are of opinion, that if I ouercome one in the Liſtes, and afterwardes releaſe him, if a newe quarrell or controuerſie befall him wyth another, by my leaue hee maye challenge his aduerſarie the Combate, whereto no man of anye reaſon or vnderſtanding ought to conſent. For if I ouercomming him ſhall haue condemned him
<pb facs="tcp:11283:122"/> as infamous, how can I allowe him fit to fight with a man as good as my ſelfe? And if hee challenge me, I ſhall refuſe him. I cannot take awaie his fault that hath beene ouercome by mee, vnleſſe that I confeſſe I ouercame him wrongfully, and ſo condemne my ſelfe of infamie: and if I cannot take awaie his blotte from him, I cannot make him equal with an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon: and therefore this opinion is wholye to be reproued of euerie Gentleman.</p>
                        <p>And as this reſtoring of a man to his honour, is by occaſion giuen mee to ſpeake of, it bringeth mee in remembraunce of the reſtoring which Princes were wont to make of treaſons and rebellions doone againſt them, and ſuch lyke faults. Wherein, to ſpeak my opinion, I thinke well that albeit the Prince may after my treaſon committed, graunt mee fauour and pardon of my lyfe and goods, and giue mee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a thouſande other fauours, yet ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make, that that which is doone ſhoulde bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doone, or that the ill fact paſt bee not an ill fact, or that I committed not anie treaſon, or that my ſoule is not defiled, and that I am not anie notorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. And that Prince whatſouer that ſhall reſtore mee, ought neuer to truſt mee, but ſhoulde rather ſtill preſume, that whereas I was once inueigled and drawen to betraye my maiſter, I will eaſilye be perſwaded againe to the like: and euery honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſon ſhould conceiue ill of me, and auoyde my company. And it ought rather to be ſaide, that I am reſtored to my goods, and the fauour of my Prince (if happilye ſhe will take me into her fauour) <pb facs="tcp:11283:122"/> than to my former honour, becauſe that albeit my Prince reſtore me to all thoſe degrees that ſhe may, yet ſhe cannot reſtore me to my firſte innocencie: as for example: if I be good, ſhe cannot make me bad, for it is not in her power to reforme my minde. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot take from good men their goodnes, nor from the wicked their wickednes: for their power extendeth on their goods and perſon, but not on their mindes: my Prince may make me poor or rich, but not good or bad, for God onely hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our affections. I conclude therefore, that if one that is reſtored from ſome notable and manifeſt villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would challenge another to combat, and that this other refuſe him, I would iudge him to haue beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe honorably, and that in reaſon he might refuſe him: for if (as I haue ſaide before) a Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to honor is not lawfull, I will leſſe think that a gentleman by licenſing one ouercome by him in combate, can make him lawfull to fight with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable perſon.</p>
                        <p>But returning to the reſtoring which I ſpake of before vſed by Princes, my opinion is, that it ought to bee good in the children of traitours, and in the reſt of their diſcent, as in thoſe that ought not beare the puniſhment of others offences, eſpecially ſeeing that thoſe that are baptiſed, are by Gods lawes freed from the ſinnes of their fathers.</p>

                        <p>This was the opinion of that gentleman, and this holde I for a gentlemanlike opinion, which euerye wiſe man ought to allow and follow: and this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is to be vnderſtoode, not onelye of thoſe who confeſſe themſelues the looſers, or run away, but of thoſe alſo who hauing had the charge of proouing, haue loſt, by not ſatisfying the proofe: becauſe that they being beſpotted with blame of falſe accuſers, by meanes of their loſſe, cannot be forced from fault of falſe accuſation, for that they were afterward falſelye accuſed: nor can they take away from themſelues the preſumption, to be accounted falſe accuſers, if they ſhould accuſe any man, ſeeing they haue beene once before condemned in the ſame: ſo that in what ſorte ſoeuer a man goe out of the liſts looſer, hee is ſubiect to the iudgement before giuen.</p>

                        <p>But here is to be vnderſtoode, that this new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for which a man may be refuſed the field, ſhuld be infamye, which a man by his owne faulte was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into, as treaſon, falſe oath, or other notable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not any iniurie or charge done him by ſome other, which might require reuenge by weapons: for in ſuch caſe, as the firſt which had a quarrell with him, might refuſe him, as become worſe in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb facs="tcp:11283:124"/> for the ſecond ſhould not refuſe to come to combate with him with whom he entered into quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, albeit he had receiued charge from any other.

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as this ſubiect of challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and defending, and of refuſing and not refuſing the fielde, is very large, and hath need of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I doe not ſee how a man may truly and fully determine of it, without ſpeaking of the degrees of nobilitie, wherin I will not call in queſtion what true nobilitie is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I holde it vndoubtedly to be vertue, and that he is truly noble that is vertuous, be he borne either of great or meane parentage, and that whoſoeuer hath not this nobilitie of vertue, of whatſoeuer ſtock hee proceede, by how much hee deſcendeth from a more noble kinred, by ſo much will I account him the more baſe, not being able to maintaine and keep the honor left vnto him by his anceſtours: for nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is ſeated in the mind, and by the mind it is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. But (as I ſaide before) I intende not to diſpute hereof, for hauing alreadie before ſhewen, that ſuch as are defiled with infamie, maye bee refuſed from proofe by weapons: it is alwaies to be vnderſtoode, that nobility is not without vertue, and my diſcourſe is to be in this ſubiect, that I ſpeake now of Duello, <pb facs="tcp:11283:125"/> what the degrees of nobilitie are that maye exerciſe weapons, by which knights come to be equall or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall: for albeit that vnder the title of Knightes, Kinges and Emperours, Gentlemen and Souldiers, be comprehended, yet there is ſuch an euident ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie betwixt them, as euery man knoweth that a Gentleman cannot compare with a King, nor a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier with an Emperour: and albeit this matter hath been diuerſlie handled by manye, yet I purpoſe to ſpeake now thereof after a new and particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, according to the cuſtome of degrees and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of our preſent time. Firſt then I alleadge, that there are many waies, whereby we may conſider the diuerſitie of degrees: for concerning the places of dignitie, I will firſte place thoſe Princes that are not ſubiect to any other, which I will call ſoueraigne Princes: next to them feodatory Kings, and them I will call moſt excellent: thirdly, men right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and after them ſuch as are titled noble men, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which title I will comprehend all the degrees of worſhip. Theſe then we are vndoubtedly to account ſuperiours to priuate Knights, and therefore as they are ſuperiours to them, ſo are they twixt themſelues vnequall: for both noble men are to giue place to the right honourable, and the right honourable to the moſt excellent, and the moſt excellent to the free and abſolute Princes. Beſides that, betwixt them of one and the ſame title, there may alſo be great inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, foraſmuch as there is a great difference, for one right honorable or noble, to depend on a free Prince or a Prince feodatorie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:126"/>And the like conſideration is to bee had of feoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory nobility, foraſmuch as one man may aſſume vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe the abſolute power of a Prince, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man can haue no greater authoritie, than as an ordinary iudge.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, it is not the leaſt regarde that wee are to haue, to their other qualities and mightines of ſigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as, if they haue vaſſales noblemen, or no: if they hold Citties, and multitudes of ſubiects, and great port, for all theſe thinges are to be reſpected, whether they be free Princes or feodatorye: whether they be moſte excellent, or right honourable, or noblemen: whether they haue this honour of free Princes or of feodatory Princes: if they haue noble and honorable men feodatories, and if they poſſeſſe noble and great ſtate: and if wee finde them not in ſome of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions to be much different, wee are rather in the controuerſie of armes, to eſteeme them equall, then to admit one of them, to refuſe the other. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no greater difference, than one to be free, and the other ſubiect: and for that ſoueraign Princes are onely truely free, and all the reſt in ſome ſorte ſubiect, we muſt conclude, that as a ſoueraigne cannot be challenged the fielde by any man of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prince ther degree, likewiſe, thoſe which wee haue tearmed moſte excellent, are not to refuſe combate with thoſe that are tearmed right honorable: if they be equall in feodatory nobility, and not vnequall in other qualities.</p>
                        <p>The like is alſo to be held betwixt right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and noblemen, ſo as their condition, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <pb facs="tcp:11283:126"/> and nobilitie of ſtate, be not too much different: for I ſee no cauſe to except againſt any man in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie of chiualrie, not to be his equall, becauſe one onely degree is different betwixt them. And as I affirme that one degree onely maketh no inequality, ſo I doe not allowe that one vnder the title of moſt excellent, may be challenged by one right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of like feodatorye nobility, but that concerning his degree, he is ſo farre inferiour vnto him: that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother caſe he would not diſdaine to receiue penci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pay of him. Neither yet will I ſaye, that one right honourable ſhould fight with a noble man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his eſtate be moſt noble: nor that one right honourable of great ſtate, may be challenged by one noble, of ſmall iuriſdiction: albeit their feodatorye nobilitie be equall.</p>
                        <p>But I will ſay, that a noble man feadatory to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince, albeit he be of leſſe degree, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding challenge one right honourable, that is feodatorie to one feodatorie, and hath greater ſigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for his feodatorie nobilitie doth ſatisfie the other inequalities.</p>
                        <p>And therfore I conclude in this point, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie of perſons, is to bee conſidered from their titles, from their feodatory nobilitie, and from their ſtates, and according as they are found to haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſe partes equall, ſo are they to bee iudged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall or vnequall.</p>
                        <p>Heereunto I will adde one other thing, which is this, that albeit their other qualities were either equal or not much different, yet the quarrell might make <pb facs="tcp:11283:127"/> great inequality: as if a prince albeit ſoueraign, would fight with an Emperour, for ſome thing that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Empire, in ſuch caſe he might lawfully be denied, foraſmuch as the Emperour by the condition of the quarrel, is true iudge therof, and conſequently alſo without compariſon of any ſuperiour.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen that are nobly borne, are either without any degree, or elſe beare office or dignitie, as gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cities, embaſſages, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in the warre: and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe that haue authority, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their office is for tearme, or for life: if for tearme, then vpon any quarrell to bee decided by armes, it may ſtay the execution of their office: if for life, and that his degree is ſuch as maketh him ſuperiour to the other, he may fight by his Champion. But if his office be not of ſuch qualitie, he that hath the charge of it, is to endeuour the good fauour of his Lord, to graunt him without looſing his office, to ſatisfie his honor: and if he cannot obtaine it, hee is to abandon all things, and to reſorte thither whether hee is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, or whether his honour vrgeth him to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge another: for as a man is not bound to any thing more ſtrictly than to his honor, ſo is the leſſer to giue <pb facs="tcp:11283:127"/> place to the greater.</p>
                        <p>Now in that a man is borne noble, he is equall to all Knights, that are of priuate condition: and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that one man were borne of a noble houſe, or right honourable, being without iuriſdiction, or ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſignorie, hee maye be challenged the fielde by any priuate Knight.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, foraſmuch as the art of warre is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſe, and becauſe manye meane men haue greatly aduaunced their houſes by it, he that ſhal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the arte of weapon, if he be without infamie, or doe exerciſe it without abuſe, is to bee reckoned and accounted amongſt noble men and Knights.</p>
                        <p>But I would not that any man ſhould vpon this thinke himſelfe made honourable, for hauing beene once in the warre, and for hauing taken pay, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued two or three moneths without euer drawing ſwoorde, or ſeeing enemy, or hearing ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, for this were as much as to dreame vpon the hyll Parnaſſus that he is a Poet, &amp; the morning not finde himſelfe ſo. It is expedient for any man that of vnno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would become noble, to get this nobilitie by armes, and it is meet for him that would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt Knights, to doe the act of a Knight: and it is required of a man to make honourable proofe of his perſon more than once, and to continue long in the warres, and to be knowne for a good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to liue as well in time of warre as of peace honeſtlye, and in ſuch ſorte that it may be perceiued he intendeth onelye to bee a Souldier, and to make that his principall butte and drift.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:128"/>And if in the ſtudie of letters a man doe not attaine vnto any degree of honour or nobilitie, but with paines and watchinges of many yeeres, let him then thinke likewiſe that hopeth to innoble himſelfe by armes, to ſweate often, to endure manye heates of Summer, and cold of winter, to watch many nights, and to ſleepe manye times in his armour vpon the hard ground, and to ſpend his blood, and by many hazardes of life, to manifeſt his prowes to the world: and when he ſhall haue perfourmed all theſe thinges, then he may thinke himſelfe truelye noble (for thoſe are noble that deſerue to be known for their deeds) and that he cannot be refuſed for want of nobilitye. Now amongſt Souldiers, a Souldier may fight with all ſortes of men, as the heads of the ſquadrons, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iants, and others vnder the degree of their Captain, for his authoritie repreſenteth ſignorie, and they maye alſo challenge them, and they are to anſwere them, being about any enterpriſe, and hauing degree by a Champion, but being returned to their priuate condition, I ſee no cauſe why they ſhould not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in perſon. And one Captaine maye challenge combate of another, except they be in place ſo vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, as one may commaund the other.</p>
                        <p>And this is to be ſaide of all ſortes of Souldiers, as well foote as horſe, adding moreouer, that a man of armes hauing beene in honorable and continuall exerciſe of warre, and liuing in all pointes as beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a man of armes, challenging a particular Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of foote, is not to be refuſed, nor may he refuſe any ſouldier ſeruing on foote.</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:128"/>And I am of opinion, that a Captaine of foote might challenge a Captaine of horſe, but onelye that for the moſt parte thoſe places are beſtowed on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages, and the conducting of men of armes is alſo beſtowed on right honourable men: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe all conditions are to be conſidered, and the qualitie of the enterpriſes that they haue, for a Captaine of foot may haue ſo honorable a degree, or be of ſo honorable familye, that there could be no cauſe to refuſe him.</p>
                        <p>And this which I haue ſpoken touching captains of foote, of horſe, and of men of armes, is alſo to bee vnderſtood of footmen twixt themſelues, and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo, be they either men of armes, or light horſe.

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue long waded through this ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcourſe of chiualrie, ſeeking to ſet downe who ought to be denyed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which matter is ſo large and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as if a man would particularlye to euery mite diſcourſe thereof, it would containe a greater volume then I intend to make, in the whole ſubiect of Duello, but it ſufficeth me to haue pointed at the fountaine where water may bee fetcht: and to conclude with my opinion touching the dutie of a Knight, I haue in the beginning of this chapter tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched two principall heads: that is, who they are that ought to be cleane thruſt from combate, and who are onelye to be refuſed, for in thoſe two almoſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie of perſons that enter or not enter Duello, are as it were conteined, foraſmuch as the wicked and infamus perſons ought to be refelled by knights: and they may be refuſed who for condition are vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, and if a man would aske why we haue not ſaid that in theſe two heads all are contained, but almoſt all, it is for that which we haue before ſpoken, of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and cleargye men, who are farre from the
<pb facs="tcp:11283:129"/> liſts, not as refelled, nor as refuſed, but as priuiledgd, and as ſuch to the qualitie and eſtimation of whoſe condition it is not meete, neither to challenge nor be challenged to proofe by armes, becauſe their ſtudie and exerciſe is far from the valour of the minde.</p>
                        <p>And to returne to our heads before propounded, I ſay, that to refel the infamous and wicked, is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and band of chiualrye, for a knight is bound to do ſo that he doe not bring in to the exerciſe of armes perſons vnworthye to appeare amongſt honourable perſons, whereof by their own fault they haue made themſelues vnworthye. Nor is there any credite to be giuen them in the proofe of armes, who are not receiued in ciuile teſtimonie: neither are diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons to enter into battailes, that are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for honour ſake.</p>
                        <p>And if any Knight ſhould make a quarrell with any perſon vncapable of Duello, the Lords (as I haue ſaid before) as well in right of chiualrie, as not for to ſuffer the field to be diſhonored, ought not to graunt the combate.</p>
                        <p>The refuſall is not of band of chiualrie, but of will of Knights, becauſe that if a man will not enter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with one of leſſe condition then himſelfe, hee may lawfully doe it, appointing a meane champion to decide the quarrel. But if a man would not reſpect degree, but would in perſon fight with one who for his condition or other defect were not his equall, he could not be ſaid to do wrong to chiualry, but rather to honour it: foraſmuch as chiualrie is not the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of condition, but of valour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:130"/>And in the diſputations of artes and more noble ſciences, no mans linnage is reſpected but his worth, and therefore a man of baſe or high degree may bee valorous, and the honour of the liſtes, is not ſo much for ouercomming one borne of noble familie, as one that is knowne for a valiant man.</p>
                        <p>Againe, as great men account it no ſhame to bee called Knights with meaner men, ſo they ought not be aſhamed to come together, to doe the oath of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie: and if a man borne of a great familie, haue no reſpect to iniury another, I know not why by reaſon of his noblenes in blood, he may refuſe to defend the ſame, and to maintaine it againſt him whom he iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and in caſe that combat were to follow vpon it, my iudgement is, that the iniurer or offender, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we terme him, is to anſwere the other in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And therefore as I thinke it a diſcommendable thing for an honorable perſon, to agree to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe equall to a perſon that for his vices were odious, albeit he deſcended of a noble race: ſo I repute it a knightly courſe, not to bee too curious in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of conditions, eſpecially when they are not ſo diuers as may ſeeme, that the frog ſtriues to be equall with the Oxe, (according to the tale.)</p>
                        <p>Again, I will adde another caſe, that as I wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him that ſhould not ſo much reſpect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as the valour of him with whom he had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, ſo I would blame him, that being of a baſe eſtate would compare himſelfe with euery great man, and would not acknowledge nor content himſelfe with his owne condition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:130"/>And this I ſpeak, not onely of thoſe that are borne meanely, but of thoſe alſo that being borne of noble blood, are yet of a priuate condition, and in queſtion of honour, would be equall with right honourable perſonages: for if they eſteeme ſo much of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for hauing blood, and being in their families of great Lords, they are to conſider, that thoſe Lords haue innobled thoſe houſes, and that they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their nobilitie from Lords, and if they haue receiued it from them, they are by ſo much leſſe then they, by how much hee is greater that giueth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man nobilitie, than he that receiueth it.</p>

                        <p>The lawes of giuing a Champion, are theſe: ſuch ought to bee giuen as are not infamous, and are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to them againſt whome they are to fight, and when one party ſhould intend to appointe a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, the other may likewiſe appoint one: But it is meete that he that will take benefite heereof, ſhould vſe ſuch courſe in his writing, that hee looſe not his prerogatiue or iuriſdiction as we will terme it: for if <pb facs="tcp:11283:131"/> a man by his writing ſhould ſay that hee will defend the quarrell in his own perſon, and afterward would appoint a Champion, the contrary parte might with reaſon refuſe it.</p>
                        <p>Againe, it is to be vnderſtoode, that the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on either ſide are to ſweate, that they thinke to fight in a iuſt quarrell, and that they will doe their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as if themſelues were intereſſed in the quarrell: and whatſoeuer Champion ſhall willinglye ſuffer himſelfe to be ouercome, is to haue one of his hands cut off, and the aduerſarye hath not ouercome, but the combate may be renued: and after that a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion hath been ouercome, he may not after that fight for any other, but for himſelfe he may.</p>
                        <p>But I will not heere omit, that albeit that nobilitie doth priuiledge the greaters to appoint Champions, ſuch yet may the caſes be, that not onely a great man with an inferiour, but a maiſter with his ſeruant, and a Prince with his ſubiect is bound to fight in perſon: for ſeeing that promiſe is a band which equally bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Prince and ſubiect, ſo no greater or leſſe band hath the one than the other: and whenſoeuer one man ſhall oppoſe vnto another, any defect of promiſe and faith, he cannot vſe his Champion, but the accuſer is to trye the quarrell in perſon with the accuſed. And therfore when a Lord ſhall accuſe his ſubiect or his ſeruant, of whatſoeuer condition hee be of violating his faith, or of women, or of treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtate, he is to proue it in his proper perſon: and the like is alſo to bee obſerued, when the ſubiect or ſeruant ſhall accuſe his Lord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:132"/>But manye Lords haue no care nor conſider not the oath and obligation of faith which they haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their ſubiects, but rechles of their faith, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly euery day commit newe defectes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they think that their greatnes doth couer their defects, and do not perceiue, that by how much they are exalted aboue other men, by ſo much their faults appeare the greater: for whereas they both by their example and lawes ought to inſtruct others in their life, they oppoſing themſelues againſt lawes, do giue other men example of wicked liuing: and therefore ſeeing that the defect of faith is a defect ſo great in Lords, it is great reaſon that they ſhould haue no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge in quarrell of faith: and if it bee not to be graunted to Lords, much leſſe is it to be graunted to perſons of other qualitie or condition.</p>
                        <p>And further it is to be vnderſtoode, that beſides the inequalitie of nobilitie, there are alſo ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of caſes, that in reſpect of perſons it is lawfull to appointe Champions, as if a man ſhall not bee of eighteene yeeres, or if he be decrepite, or ſicke, or in ſuch ſorte hindered in his bodye, as hee is not fitte to fight.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow and in what manner the Duello or Combat hath bin vſed, they may knowe that haue turned ouer the Records &amp; Annals of paſſed ages. And ſeeing it is now long ſince out of cuſtome, and not permitted by the lawes, I thinke it not neceſſarie to bee much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this place. I will onely ſaie this, that in times paſt it was had in verie reuerent account, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thought it an honorable qualitie to bee able to diſcourſe of thoſe points and rules that were agreed vpon amongſt Princes, and by them approued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning free and open Combat. My intention is, to giue gentlemen warning how they appoint the field with their enemies, ſeeing it is not permitted by the lawes to bee done publikely, as by ancient cuſtome it was wont to be allowed. For it may ſo fall out, that a Gentleman hauing paſſed his word to meet his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie in ſome ſecret place, after hee hath valiantly wounded him, and reported the victorie of him in the appointed place, his ſayde aduerſarie may accuſe him of fellonie, and ſaie that hee robbed him, and ſo where the quarrell ſhould haue an end, he ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to enter into newe troubles, and begin againe. It <pb facs="tcp:11283:133"/> may alſo ſo chance that his aduerſarie hath ambuſhes prepared for him, &amp; ſo he may be murdered, &amp; being dead, his enemie may vaunt of hauing brauely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered him by right and valour. I haue my ſelfe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in Countries beyond the ſeas, two Captaines, the one named Faro, the other Montarno de Garda, the Lord of Mandelot, gouernour of Leon, met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereof the one trecherouſlie minded, prayed the other to ſhew whether he was not priuily armed: whereupon as ſoone as Captain Montarno had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his doublet, he preſently ranne him through, and ſeeing him fall downe dead (as hee thought) on the ground, returned into the citie with counterfeit glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as if he had done wonders, vntil by hap the poore Capteine was found by his friends yet liuing, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraie the other Captaines villanie. Like examples many haue happened, and that not ſo far hence, but many vndoubtedly are acquainted with them. I woulde in lyke manner aduertiſe Gentlemen, of an euill cuſtome which of late yeres hath inſtalled it ſelf amongſt men of all ſortes and nations: to bee deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with broiles and hurliburlies, to ſet men together by the eares, &amp; cauſe quarrels betwixt friends, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and kinsfolke: whereas it was wont to bee a matter of great conſequence, and of ſuch nature, as it might not be otherwiſe decided, which ſhould bring men ſo mortallye at defiaunce, as nothing but the ſword could finiſh the quarrell. Now vppon euerie occaſion Armes are taken, and one friend for a word will not only violate the ſacred reſpect which ought to be zealouſlie obſerued in friendſhippe, by turning <pb facs="tcp:11283:133"/> their familiaritie into ſtrangenes, their kindneſſe into malice, &amp; their loues into hatred, but alſo accompany this ſtrange and vnnaturall alteration with a wicked reſolution of ſeeking one anothers ouerthrowe, not reſting till the enmitie be confirmed by fight, &amp; fight ended by death.</p>
                        <p>O the reuerent eſteeme and account wherin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages had the Combat! And why? Forſooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Gentleman ſought the ruine or deſtruction one of another, and neuer vndertooke tryall by the ſword but in defence of his innocencie, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his honor vnfained and blotleſſe. Now malice and hatred ouerrunneth all, ſtrife and rancor are the bellows of quarrels, and men vpon euerie light cauſe enter into more actions of defiance, than for any iuſt occaſion offered in reſpect of iuſtice and honour.</p>
                        <p>One fault more, beſides theſe which I haue alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die mentioned, is fairely growen amongeſt vs, that if anie of our friendes ſaie to vs but one worde to this effect, Come will you go with mee, I muſt fight with ſuch a one, and I knowe not what partakers hee hath, We are preſently readie not onely to go wyth him our ſelues, but to drawe others into the minde with vs alſo, without any conſideration had of the manner of the quarrell, how iuſtly or iniuſtly it grew, and ſo often times wee bolſter wrong againſt right: whereas wee ſhould enter into examination of his cauſe, learne the quarrell, and ſearch for the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cauſes of their falling out, and beeing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith, though wee finde him to haue reaſon for his rage, (for I know not how els to terme
<pb facs="tcp:11283:134"/> terme that paſſion that leades men to that mortal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, vpon what iuſt occaſion ſoeuer) yet ought we not to accompany, nor to further him, no not to ſuffer him to fight, if the matter can poſſiblye by any other meanes be taken vp and ended: for ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a triall in my opinion, is to be reſerued for ſuch occaſions as neceſſarily require it: and what or how many ſuch there be, I leaue to be perpended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by them that can beſt diſcerne matters of ſo great waight: and ſo I will come to thoſe pointes, which I imagine it will not be amiſſe heere to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing wee haue already treated ſufficientlie of Duello, as farre as is neceſſary for a Knight to vnderſtande, mee thinketh it alſo verye conuenient to ſpeake ſomewat of ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to bee made when a man knoweth he hath wrongfullye iniuried or charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And before I proceede, I cannot but greatlye condemne an olde and common opinion, which is this: that when a man hath doone or ſpoken anye thing good or bad, he ſhould defend and maintaine it for good, which opinion how it is to be approued, I will laye open for euerye man of vnderſtanding to iudge.</p>
                        <p>Foraſmuch as man is principally diſtinguiſhed by his reaſon from brute beaſtes, as often as hee ſhall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any thing without reaſon and with violence, hee worketh like a beaſt, and is transfourmed euen into a verye beaſt, as thoſe afore time did very well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, who deſcribing men metamorphoſed into <pb facs="tcp:11283:135"/> b ſtes, ſignified no thing els but that thoſe men had done acts proper to thoſe beaſtes, whereof they tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them to haue the ſhape.</p>
                        <p>Now then if men be turned into beaſts by doing like beaſtes, we may alſo ſaye, that ſo long they abide in that fourm, as they continue in that action or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that their abode in that is ſo: and they haue no other meanes to diſ-beaſt themſelues (as I will terme it) than by acknowledging their fault, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and making amendes thereof, and a man ſhould ſtrictly follow reaſon, as the cheefe guide and miſtres of his life: and if happily hee ſhould at any time happen to offend (as it is common to man) hee ſhould with all poſſible ſpeede recall himſelfe, ſeeing it is a heauenly thing to amend.</p>
                        <p>But to ſpeake particularly of matters of chiualrie, we take the office and dutie of this degree to bee, to to help the oppreſſed, to defend iuſtice, to beat down the proud: where ſome cleane contrarily doe turne their ſworde, the enſigne and armes of iuſtice, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe reaſon, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit iniuſtice, and to confound the truth: and this wicked opinion and peruerſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is ſo rooted in the common ſorte, as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a baſe thing for a man to proceede with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to conſent to equitie: but albeit they be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that follow this corrupt vſe, yet the better ſorte of ſpirites do approue that ſentence which is preached. And I haue heard of <hi>Signor Luigi Gonzaga,</hi> who dyed Captaine of the Romiſh Church, whoſe valour hath beene ſo well knowne, as no man ought to think that euer hee was ſtayed from anye noble enterpriſe
<pb facs="tcp:11283:135"/> through the baſenes of his minde, that he was woont to ſaye, that if hee ſhould be knowne to haue ſpoken or doone any bad thing, for the which hee was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to proue it by armes, rather then hee would fight for the falſe againſt the truth, and for the bad againſt the good, he would freely diſclaime from it, and deny it.</p>
                        <p>And this no doubt is to bee helde a manlye and a chriſtian like deede, for reaſon wils vs to doe ſo, and lawe and the dutie of the degree of chiualrye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, and all doctrine as well philoſophicall as Chriſtian, doth teach vs the ſame.</p>

And that which wee ſee in the earth of the ſeedes of things, is likewiſe ſeene in men of good and badde <pb facs="tcp:11283:136"/> mindes: for the bad through our naturall corruption is conceiued, receiued, and generally embraced of vs all: whereas the good is vnwillinglye receiued, and we ſtoppe our eares leaſt wee ſhould heare of it, for there belongeth great ſtudie to vnderſtand the truth, and much paines to bring to paſſe that our mindes bee capable of it: and therefore by how much the paines is the greater, by ſo much is to be ſaid they are fewer that haue true knowledge of the truth: in which reſpect, it is no meruaile if the vulgare opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be ſo farre from the truth.</p>

                        <p>But in wrongs committed, two thinges are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly woont to be conſidered, the thing whereby a man is wronged, and the manner how it was doone: for from the deede commeth the iniurie, and from the manner commeth the charge: as for example, <hi>Henry</hi> giueth the baſtonata to
<hi>Edward</hi> when hee had no cauſe to take heed of him, and after he hath giuen it: runneth away: in this action the ſtroke is the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="tcp:11283:137"/> and the charge is, that <hi>Edward</hi> is bound to proue that he did it ſhamefully. And to make them frends, <hi>Henry</hi> will ſaye that hee did <hi>Edward</hi> this iniurie vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares to him, and when hee had no cauſe to beware of him, and after hee had ſtricken him, hee went his way in ſuch ſorte, as <hi>Edward</hi> could not make ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reuenge, and that he is not a man of equal degree to charge him, nor wrong him, more then the other is to wrong him: and by theſe words manifeſting the manner how hee wronged <hi>Edward,</hi> hee diſchargeth him from the band of proouing this act to bee villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous: for there needs no proofe of that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, ſo as all the iniurie reſteth on him, for which be he great or meane, it is an ordinary matter to aske him forgiuenes.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer the words according to conditions, the age, and profeſſion of the parties, may alter &amp; change it, that it be referred to the iudgement of the meaner. Some men would haue, that a man ſhould confeſſe to haue done badlye or trecherouſlye, for ſaying or doing ſuch a thing, and doe not perceiue that the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of theſe words, is when a thing is done in a bad and euill manner: and therefore I would not haue any man make more account of words, then of the meaning of them: and after that by the meaning the offended is diſcharged, to ſeeke other wordes, is not to vnburthen himſelfe, but to burthen the other more greeuouſly.

                        <p>In this caſe me thinketh there is no doubt, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his ſhame the greater that did the iniurie, nor his that receiued it, (according as wee haue ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) for if I confeſſe to haue committed a defect, and thou through my confeſsion art iuſtified from not hauing done amiſſe, wherof ſhouldſt thou not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with asking forgiuenes I cannot conceiue any ſo hainous an iniurie, as in my iudgement ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction may not ſuffice, eſpeciallye ſeeing it hath euer been the vſe of moſt gentlemanlike mindes, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to forgiue.</p>

And to confirme that which I ſaide, that words may be ſufficient ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for iniurie by deedes: I alleadge, that if happilye one man were mightilye outraged by another, and ſhould write to him that hee meant to proue it, that he had doone a vile act, and like a bad man and ill knight: and the other anſwering him, ſhould confeſſe as much, it is certain that no further quarrell ſhould remaine, nor band of honour betwixt them.</p>
                        <p>Yea, and if being come to the liſtes, in making the

Which ſaying, how farre it is <pb facs="tcp:11283:139"/> worthy to be approued, may be perceiued from that which we haue already ſpoken. And I doe not think that any man of good vnderſtanding, (if he ſhal truly know that he hath ſtricken another, either with his hand or cudgel) to make peace, wil ſay that he wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him like a traitor, or ſhamefullye.

Now ſeeing that ſo manifeſt contrarietie is comprehended from ſo open contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they ſhould alſo perceiue their errour, and perceiuing it, reclaime themſelues from it: eſpecially conſidering, that as theſe two opinions are contrarye twixt themſelues, ſo reſon is contrary to them both: and that ſurelye is a commendable &amp; gentlemanlike opinion which is founded vpon law and reaſon. And according to this opinion are honorable perſons and deſirous of valour, to frame themſelues, that no one thing is to be eſteemed valorous or honourable, if it be not accompanied with reaſon.</p>

And therefore whoſoeuer being moued with iuſt diſdain, and iuſt occaſion, ſhall conuenientlye reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt any man, hee is not to make other ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, then to ſay, that he is ſoary to haue had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to haue vſed ſuch an act againſt him, and that if he had done it without cauſe, he ſhould haue doone ill or like a badde man, or not like a Gentleman, or knight, or ſuch like wordes, and hee may alſo intreat him to be freends with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hee that hath giuen cauſe thereof to the other, acknowledging his fault, ſhould content himſelfe with as much as reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and not continue in his errour, if hee will not (as was ſaide before) remaine transfourmed into a brute beaſt.</p>
                        <p>And if vpon anye woordes, two ſhould fight, and one of them ſhould be hurte, it were not to bee doubted that without further adoe they might not <pb facs="tcp:11283:140"/> be made freends, for that blood doth waſh awaye all blot, of which ſoeuer of them it was: nor can any of them be reproued of defect, when both of them did manifeſt a bolde and knightly minde.</p>
                        <p>And if it happen that one man ſhould any way of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend another, &amp; that he which is offended ſhould lay hand on his weapons, and the other ſhould fly, albeit the offended could not come to him, hee that ſhould flye were to bee condemned for a vilde man and a coward, and the other ſhould be honoured: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as honor is ſeated in the face and in the hands, and not in the ſhoulders and feete. But to come to be made freends, he ſhould confeſſe his baſenes, and ask forgiuenes of his offence.</p>
                        <p>And if one man ſhould offend another not in any ill ſorte, but wrongfullye, and the other doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge himſelfe being able to doe it preſently, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender according to the qualitie of the perſon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhall confeſſe to haue doone wrong, or to haue done againſt reaſon, or ſuch a thing as he ought not, or not like a gentleman: and in all theſe ſortes yet he is to aske him forgiuenes thereof.</p>
                        <p>But if happilye twixt maskers (as often it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) not knowing one another, one of them bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured, the amends ſhould be to ſay, I knewe you not, and if I had knowne you, I would not haue doone ſo vnto you, but if I had doone it, I ſhould haue doone diſcurteouſly, or villanouſlye, or like a bad Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, asking pardon for it: the like courſe is to be held when one man ſhould offend another by night in the darke.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene ſaide before, that the foundation of ſatiſfactions dooth conſiſt in the truth, and to confirme the ſame, when a man hath oppoſed againſt another any defect vntruly, hee ought to confeſſe that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſo as hee ſaide, and may alleadge in excuſe of himſelfe (if the truth be not oppoſite againſt it) that he ſpake it either thinking it to be ſo, or becauſe it was tolde him, or els in choller: and if hee ſhall ſay that he thought ſo, he ſhall adde, he was deceiued, or that he thought amiſſe, and that he knoweth the truth
<pb facs="tcp:11283:141"/> to be otherwiſe: if he ſay it was tolde him, he ſhall ſay that he which tolde it him, ſaide not the truth: and if he ſay he ſpake it in choller, hee ſhall then ſay that he knoweth the truth to be other, that he is ſoarye for it, or diſcontented or greeued. And in this ſort al words ſpoken maye be expreſſed and declared with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſence, as for example: I haue calde thee traitor, when I knew thee to be an honorable and iuſt knight: and as often as there is demonſtration that the truth is contrarye to that ſpoken, hee that is iniured, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. And if a man would not make mention of the iniurious wordes, if hee ſhould reuoke them in ſuch ſorte as I haue ſaide, or with words of honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable witnes, the charge ſhould neuertheles be taken away: and if one man ſhould giue another the lye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon words of wrath, hee ought alſo to reuoke it. But if a man ſhould make daintye, to ſaye I haue belyed thee, he might yet in another ſorte honeſtly prouide for it, for he may ſay, I confeſſe the words true ſpoken by thee whereupon our quarrell is growen, or els he may expreſſe the very matter it ſelfe, and allowe it to be true: and I will not omit, that ſeeking meanes to make quietnes in controuerſies, I haue ſometimes ſo handled a matter, as I haue made agreement by ſuch away, that he which gaue the lye, hath ſpoken to the other in this ſorte: I would be glad to know of you with what minde you gaue me hard words the other day, whereupon I gaue you the lye, and I praye you reſolue me heerein and the other hath anſwered, to tell you the truth, I ſpake them in choller, and not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any other occaſion: and the firſt hath replyed, <pb facs="tcp:11283:141"/> ſince you haue ſpoken thoſe words in choller, I aſſure you that I meant not to haue giuen you the lye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you had ſpoken them with a deliberate minde, to charge me, and I ſaye that that my lye dooth not charge you, but rather I acknowledge you for a man of troth, and I praye you remember no diſcurteous words paſt betwixt vs, but hold me for your freend: and the other hath anſwered, and I do likewiſe iudge you a man of honor, beſeeching you alſo to account me your freend. And this forme of ſatisfaction may bee applied to a thouſand caſes that happen daylye: and by this example other formes and rules maye be found according to the qualitie of the caſes.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, it dooth happen, that when a man is greeued at anothers ill wordes of him, hee denyeth that hee ſpake them, which ſome men make queſtion whether it ſhould be taken for a full ſatisfaction, for ſome would haue him ſay, I ſpake them not, but if I had done it, I had ſpoken falſely, or other like wordes of ſence. And touching this doubt, me thinketh that if a man ſhould ſpeake ill of me, in denying to haue ſpoken it, he ſhould greatly ſhame himſelfe, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he ſhould not giue me ſatisfaction, &amp; yet he ſhould be found to haue wronged me: &amp; therfore it is not ſufficient only to deny, but a further matter is conuenient. And if a man haue not ſpoken il, he may recite all things, and if he haue ſpoken it, he ought to ſaye ſomething to ſatisfie the other, and the wordes which he is to ſay are theſe: I haue not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, but if I had, I ſhould haue ſpoken vntruth, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted that which I ought not, nor like a gentleman, or ſuch like. <pb facs="tcp:11283:142"/> But a gentleman ſhould not be brought to deny that which hee hath ſpoken, but rather ſhould confeſſe it, and make ſatisfaction: and if hee ſhould not deny it to be true, but ſhould ſay that in ſpeaking it it, hee hath offended him, that hee ſhould not haue ſpoken it, or that he did ill, and craue pardon for it, for in all caſes where an offence is, it is requiſite to ask pardon. And a man may alſo offend in ſpeaking the truth, if his intent be to offend.</p>

                        <p>We read in hiſtories of ancient times, that a King of the Perſians dying, left two ſonnes, each demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Empire, and yet while the matter was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, they conuerſed and liued together in al kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and brotherly louingnes, till it was in the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the peeres of the Empire, which of them was choſen and elected to be the King, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tooke ſo well, that hee would not in any caſe be brought to think either vnkindely of his brother, or euill of the electors, he hauing what he aſpired vnto, and they doing what they thought beſt and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienteſt for the Countrie: Such diſcretion would doe well in all men, to cut from them manye incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, debates, ſtrifes and quarrels.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing diſcourſed of the inequalitie in nobility, and eſpecially of priuate noblemen and gentlemen, I wil not take occaſion now to ſay any thing of the meanes and maner whereby men riſe vnto honour and dignitie, nor of the greatnes and nobilitie of kingdomes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces and citties, conſidering that this matter hath been ſo largelye and laudablye handled by many, as appeares by the reading of the ancient and moderne hiſtories, which are filled with diſcourſes tending to this purpoſe: this I will onelye ſaye by the way, that thoſe places haue beene famed for moſt noble, and had in greateſt account, which haue produced bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt men, commended vnto poſteritie for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue either intellectuall or actiue, morall or politicke, ciuile or militarie: and as places are made famous or enobled by reaſon of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men that are there borne, ſo alſo can no place how barbarous ſoeuer it be, drowne or darken the glorie and commendation due vnto a man ennobled by valour, prudence, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues whatſoeuer, as Anacharſis being noted by one to be a Scithian, anſwered as ſharpely as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, true indeed by birth, but not by bringing vp: ſo that howbeit he was a Scithian borne, yet were his <pb facs="tcp:11283:147"/> manners not barbarous, nor his life Scithian like, but deſerued the commendation due to ciuile and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education. But I will leaue the vertues and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of men, and turne my ſpeech to women, hoping they will not be offended with me if I diſcouer the vertues and noble diſpoſition of their ſexe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as deſerue higheſt commendation, I vtterly diſalow of their opinion, that not onely not attribute nobilitie vnto women, but alſo abridge them from power and abilitie, to ennoble and imparte nobilitie vnto others. We read of many excellent women both of high and low eſtate, in diuers hiſtories, whoſe fame hath been carried through the world for rare vertue, ſome for valour, others for learning, others for wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, others for chaſtitie, others for other ſingular vertues and commendable partes: manye Queenes and noble Ladies haue gotten great renown and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious for armes and warlike exploites: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue had their names dedicated to euerlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance euen by the memoriall of their owne pennes, hauing been moſt exquiſite writers and pen-women themſelues, both for proſe and verſe. In my opinion then are women greatly wronged by them that ſeeme to take from them power of transferring nobilitie to others, excluding them from ſo great an honor, they notwithſtanding hauing great reaſon to be copartners with men therein: for excellency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in vertue of the body and the minde, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being endewed with both beautye and vertue, and ſeeing that women can learne whatſoeuer men can, hauing the full vſe of reaſon (or elſe nature who <pb facs="tcp:11283:147"/> doth neuer do any thing in vaine) ſhould haue to no purpoſe giuen them the gifte of vnderſtanding: I thinke they deſerue fellowſhip and communing in honor with men, conſidering nature hath beſtowed on them aſwel as on men, meanes to attain vnto lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wiſedome, and al other vertues actiue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue: which is made manifeſt by the example of many that haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the opinion of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and excellencie, by their rare vertue, and almoſt incredible prowes. And to recite the worthy actes of ſome, I will wholye commit and paſſe by the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones, their ſtory being counted fabulous, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome, whoſe valiant &amp; vertuous acts haue been recorded in true hiſtories, aſwell of olde times, as of our times. The king Argus hauing by reaſon of long continued wars great want of men, Theſelide a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a cittie wherin Argus was beſieged by Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes king of Lacedemony, prouoked the other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the cittie to take armes, and leading them out at the gates, deliuered the Cittie from ſiege, and put their enemies to ſhameful flight. I wil not heer ſpeak of the valour of Artemiſia, of Iſicrate, of Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, of Tomiris, of the women of Lacedemony, of Debora, of Iudith, and other vertuous and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, yea holye and ſacred Ladies, whoſe hiſtoryes are contained in the holy Scripture: but I will come vnto thoſe whoſe life was not ſo long ſince, but that we may well remember them. About the time that the Engliſhmen vnder Charles the 6. had brought in ſubiection the greteſt part of that kingdom, there was a yong maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called Iane Pulzela, daughter to a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the Duke of Loraine, who not yet reaching <pb facs="tcp:11283:148"/> to the fifteenth yeere of her age, was accounted to be a Propheteſſe, and of many helde to be a witch, but this maketh not to the purpoſe: the King beeing in great doubt of his fortune, ſent for her to know whether he ſhould loſe the reſt of his kingdome alſo or no, and hauing anſwere that hee ſhould become victorious in the end, gaue the more credite vnto it, becauſe many of his noblemen aſſured him that ſhe had the ſpirite of prophecie, recounting many things vnto him which ſhe had declared in priuate mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. Afterward ſhe tooke armes her ſelfe, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her ſelfe in ſuch ſorte among the other Captains and men of armes, that in a verye ſhorte time ſhe was made Captaine generall of the whole armye, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed and mounted on a barbed horſe, in ſuch ſorte as ſhe was not knowne but to be a man, made a ſally with all her troupes both horſe and foote, and aſſailing the enemie with an vndaunted courage, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her enterpriſe with ſuche valour and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſhe freed the Cittie of Orleance from the ſiege, being her ſelfe ſhot through the ſhoulder with an arrow: thence ſhe led her companye to Troe in Campanie, where beeing encamped, againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of all the Captaines and Souldiers, tooke the cittie in very ſhorte time, and cauſed Charles the ſeauenth to be crowned in Rheymes, as the ancient cuſtome is, hauing firſt deliuered the cittie from the ſiege which the enemie had laide vnto it. Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter battering Paris, and clambring on the walles as being famous amongſt the ſtouteſt Souldiers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her legge was pierced quite through <pb facs="tcp:11283:148"/> with an arrowe, gaue not ouer the enterpriſe for all that, but perſiſted till ſhe had effected it. Petrarch writeth, that he knewe a damſell at Pozzuelo called Marie, who borrowing the habit of a yong man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion men wore their apparell there, armed her ſelfe, and was euen the firſte that fought with the enemie, and the laſt that retired: Viſina wife vnto Guido the cheefe of the houſe of Torrello, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how the venecians had laid ſiege to Guaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lla a caſtle of her husbands, hee being abroad, armed herſelfe, and led a companye of men to the place, and ſpoyling many Venecians, defended the Caſtle. Margaret daughter to Valdiner King of Suetia, and wife to Aquinus King of Norway, remained inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix vnto theſe Kingdomes in the right of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and of her father, and in the right of her ſonne Olaus alſo of Dacia, but the Duke of Monopoli wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging warre againſt her, ſhee encountred him with a mightie armie, defeated his forces, tooke him priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and led him in her triumph after the ſolemn or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Romans.</p>
                        <p>Mahomet King of the Turkes, waging warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Venecians, ſent a great armie vnder the conduct of one of his generall Captaines, to take the iſle of Metelino, and beſieging Coccino very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the inhabitants iſſued and fought verye valiantlye againſt the Turkes: in the ſame Cittie was a young maide, who ſeeing her father ſlaine by the Turkes in this fight, and the Citizens beginning to fainte and feare, got into the former companies, and skirmiſhed ſo couragiouſlye with the Turkes, that all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens <pb facs="tcp:11283:149"/> aſhamed to ſee themſelues ouercome in ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and courage by a ſimple girle, tooke hart and vtterlye deſtroyed their enemies, and ſaued the Cittie.</p>
                        <p>Bona Lombarda, firſt ſeruant and afterward wife to Petro Brunoro of Parma, being in the warres that the Venecians had againſt Franceſco Sforza Duke of Millaine, after Pauono a caſtle in the territories of Breſcia was taken, with her courage and gallant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes recouered it againe.</p>
                        <p>Margaret wife to Henry King of England, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Renatus King of Naples, being informed that her husband was ouercome in battaile and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, preſentlye gathered certaine companies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and leading them to a place wherby the enemie was to paſſe, encountred him, ouerca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e his camp, and purſuing them that fled with her husband the King, ſlewe an infinite company of men, and in the end ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, and returned home with him, and got him this moſt glorious victorie.</p>
                        <p>I remember that I being a youth, a freend of mine ſonne to a Trumpet that was in pay vnder the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the ſignorie of Venice, was with a certaine coſin of his ſet vpon by eleuen other yong men that were their enemies, which his mother perceiuing, took a Partiſan in her hands, and defended her ſonne and coſin, and ſorely wounding fiue of their enemies made the reſt to flye.</p>
                        <p>Being in Rauenna, I ſawe in one of the Churches the carued image of a Ladie, who, being wife to a Gentleman that was cheefe of the houſe of Raſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, <pb facs="tcp:11283:149"/> had euer in her life time accompanied her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in all his warres, and atchiued immortall fame by her proweſſe and valour.</p>
                        <p>I was in Lombardie on a daye which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſolemniſed, according to the cuſtome ouer the whole Countrie, and it happened at that time, that there was a great quarrell betweene two rich houſes, among the Farmers and countrymen of that place, the one part of which were called the Romani, and the other the Ferrariſi, both beeing vnder the Duke of Ferrara, and meeting on this vniuerſall feaſt daye at a village called Trefenta, one of the Romani ſhot a Piſtole at the cheefe of the Ferrariſi, and thinking to haue wounded him, miſſed him and hurte one of the Ferrariſi their wiues, who was of ſo valiant a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, that howbeit ſhe was ſhot quite through, yet ſaid nothing to her freends, nor complained of it, leaſte they ſhould haue lefte their enemies and come to help her, and ſo many of them might haue in meane while been ſpoyled by the aduerſe parte, but ſnatching a weapon out of one of the country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens handes, ſlewe him that had ſhot her, and his fellowe that fought by him, and ſo fell downe her ſelfe, not able to performe any more, liuing but foure daies after.</p>
                        <p>I haue read in the Cronicles of France, that two great men growing to be enemies, for the dukedome of Bretagne, the one prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding an eſtate in the ſame, in right of his father, as being his by inheritance, the other claiming intereſt in it by the right of his wife, as her doury, &amp;c. one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was much fauoured by the <pb facs="tcp:11283:150"/> King of Fraunce, and the other of the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: theſe two riſing vp in arms, one of them whom the King there leaſt fauoured, was taken and put in priſon, and the Frenchmen began to ſpoile his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and take his tenantes, and comming to a Cittie where the Lady was, wife to him that was taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it, and often aſſailed it though in vaine, for ſhe like a right valiant gentlewoman, and of a manly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, prouided that not one woman in the Cittie ſhould bee idle, but bring her helping hand for the defence of the Cittie, and maintenance of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, cauſing ſome to make inſtruments of pitch and tarre and fire workes, others to bring ſtones, ſeething water, and other things neceſſary at that inſtant and neceſſitie: and very oftentimes iſſued very valorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and brauelye, and firing her enemies tentes, put them to great loſſe and confuſion, ſlaying manye of them, but they daylye receiuing new ſupplies from the King, ſhe was forced to ſend for ſome ſuccour to the King of England, for which whileſt ſhe ſtaied, they draue her to manye inconueniences, for the people began to mutter and to mutinie within the Cittie, finding great want and ſcarcitie, by reaſon whereof many dyed, and ſhe was much ſollicited and importuned to deliuer vp the Cittie to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and not knowing how to anſwere them, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to ſtaye for Gods mercie but ſo manye dayes, (limiting a certaine time) and if no aide came in the meane while, then ſhee would doe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: thoſe daies being expired, whilſte ſhee was he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilie muſing what anſwere to make her citizens, that <pb facs="tcp:11283:150"/> had verye earneſtlye beſought her againe to render, ſpyed the Engliſh nauie on the ſeas, and calling them to her window, comforted them with that ſight, and cauſed all things to be prepared and made in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that when her Engliſh freends were landed and ſhould aſſault the enemy, ſhe might with her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies make a ſallie to meete them and bid them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to the deſtruction and vtter ouerthrow of her enemies, which ſhee did, and ſlewe ſo manye of the Frenchmen, that all the countrie was amazed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and ſhee maintained warres againſt them a long time after.</p>
                        <p>I haue read in the hiſtories of the Turks, how that Selim Sultan hauing obtained the Empire after hee had poyſoned his Father and ſtrangled his Brother Corcut, who was a Philoſopher, with a mightye ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye purſued his Brother Accomat, whom the King of Perſia Vſan Caſſano much fauoured and holpe with men, prouiſion, and monye: but the Bretheren meeting together, and the victorie being very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a great while, in the end Selim Sultan ouercame by the valour of his Ianizaries, for the Perſians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with their horſes broken quite through the whole battaile, and entring on the Ianizaries in the middeſt of whom the Turke Selim Sultan was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they diſcharged a volly of ſhot vpon the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who vnuſed to heare ſuch a noyſe, were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye diſmaied, and inſtantlye forced to take their flight, by which meanes Sultan Selim obtained a wonderfull great victorie, and his brother Accomat was ſtrangled by his Ianizaries, who after the fight <pb facs="tcp:11283:151"/> was done, found among them that were taken and dead, an infinite company of Perſian Gentlewomen that were come all armed as Knightes, to fight with their husbands, but Selim Sultan cauſed the dead to be ſolemnly buried, and thoſe who were ſaued, to be ſent home to their Countries very honourably.</p>
                        <p>In the yere 1571. at the time that Selim Emperour of the Turkes, and father to Amurat that now liueth, waged war againſt the Venecians, the Baſſa that was generall by Sea, went to the cittie Raguzi in the Iſle of Carſola, and began to batter it, which the cittizens perceiuing, and fearing the danger, fled with their goods &amp; ſuch things as they made moſt account of, into the Iſle, and left none but women at home, who choſing rather to dye then fall into the Turks hands, went valiantly to the walles, and one of them putting fire to a peece of Ordinance, ſtrooke away with the bullet the lantern of the Baſſa, wherupon he hoiſted ſayle and fled, and ſo the cittie was ſaued.</p>
                        <p>In the time of Charles the fifth, and Francis King of France, they hauing ſouldiers in Italy, by reaſon of the diſcention and factions among the Italians, the citie of Siena was beſieged, where a gentlewoman of the houſe of Picholhomini was made Coronell of 3000. other women, and atchiued wonderfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to the aſtoniſhment of al the people. I haue been toulde by diuers, of a Portingall gentlewoman that for religions ſake about 4. yeeres now paſt, left of the apparell of her ſexe, and went as a ſouldier into Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, where ſhe behaued her ſelfe ſo reſolutelye, that ſhe was in ſhort time after made a Captaine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <pb facs="tcp:11283:151"/> very famous, fearfull to her enemies, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of her freends: in the end ſhe chanced to go to confeſſion, and bewraied her ſex to her confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who tolde her that it was a great ſinne to delude the worlde, in taking vpon her the perſon of a man, which ſhe could not do without offending God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, he told the Biſhop of it, and the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was known through the Country where ſhe was: wherupon diuers noblemen knowing her to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man, deſired to be maried vnto her, but ſhee refuſed them, in regarde that ſhe had euer loued a nephew of the Biſhops, and conuerſed with him very priuately before ſhe was known, and therefore being diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would not marry any one but him, for that ſhee would admit none to that neer point of acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as he was, but him that ſhould be her husband, being of as good a diſpoſition that way, as ſhee was in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of valour and courage. She was ſeene afterward in Liſhbone apparelled like a woman, but armed like a knight, leading a troupe of men, the conducting of which ſhe had obtained for her husband.</p>
                        <p>It were a worke infinite for me to rehearſe all ſuch famous Ladies as haue been renowmed for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, neither were it poſſible for any man truelye to make a collection of all their gallant deeds, ſeing they are in number ſo exceeding: but as I haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and called to remembrance ſome who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in magnanimity, courage, and greatnes of the minde, ſo will I now alſo ſet downe the names of ſome that paſſed in greatnes of vnderſtanding, and excelled in intellectuall vertues.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11283:152"/>Saffo of Lesbos was inferiour to few Poets in that Arte, and ſuperiour to many. Erinna wrote a Poeme in the Dorike tung, compared to Homers diuine worke. Corina fiue times put downe Pindarus that great Poet. Pythagoras learned many thinges of his ſiſter Themiſtoclea, and his daughter Dama was ſo excellent in learned miſteries, that ſhee commented and expounded the difficulte places in her Fathers workes. Areta of Cirena, after the death of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ariſtippus, kept the ſchoole while ſhe liued, and read Philoſophie lector dayly, and wonderfullye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the auditorie. Leontia wrote againſt Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus Ariſtotles ſcholler. Hipatia was very skilfull in Aſtronomie, and profeſſed it publiquelye a long time in Alexandria. But to leaue the Grecian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen and come to the Italian, Sempronia of Rome, was excellently well ſpoken both in Greeke and Latine, ſhe was a fine Poet and wrote very ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Cornelia Africanus his wife, was nothing inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vnto the former: nor Hortenſia who was in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie her Fathers true heire, in eloquence and Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Sulpitia a Roman Lady, in Heroical verſe, deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the pitifull time of Domitian the Emperour. In our times we haue heard of Ruſſuida of Saxony, who was excellent in the tunges, and hath written diuers treatiſes and Poems, very commendably. Batiſta el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt daughter to Galeazo Lord of Peſſaro, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent proofes of her learning, and wrote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pamphlets. In the ſame Cittie of Peſſaro was a gentlewoman called Laura Brenzara, who hath wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many verſes both Latin and Italian, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <pb facs="tcp:11283:152"/> for her excellencie in making of Orations and extemporall ſpeeches in both tungs, Latine and Italian. At Padua where I was borne, in my time was a Gentlewoman of good reckoning, that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ciuile lawe publiquelye, came dayly into the colleges and ſchooles, and diſputed with all the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and ſchollers of the vniuerſitie. Caſſandra a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of Venice, was commended for great skill in languages, and ſpake very eloquently, ſhe could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo write very wel, as apppeered by diuers bookes ſhe hath ſet forth, among which hath been known a book of the order of the ſciences.</p>
                        <p>But I wil content my ſelfe, hauing produced theſe examples, in proofe of the valour and vertue of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, concluding with onely one more, which as the beſt, I kept to be laſt: heerein imitating the beſt ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who euer reſerue the ſtrongeſt argumentes for the laſt. Theſe lines therefore ſhalbe adorned and honoured with the name of this moſt glorious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe Elizabeth our gracious Queene, whoſe fame hath built her towers of triumphes, euen in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries fartheſt remoued from her, and forced her very enemies in the ſtorme of their malice and ſpite, to praiſe her name, to admire her mercifulnes and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to feare her power: this is ſuch a manifeſt and worthy example of womanly worthines and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine perfection, that the perfecteſt men muſt by truths enforcement acknowledge themſelues moſt vnperfect, in regarde of the meaneſt perfection that heauen moſt bountifullye hath beſtowed on her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred maieſtie, who liueth yet renowmed through <pb facs="tcp:11283:153"/> the whole worlde, the Sunne of Chriſtendome, and the onely Starre wherby all people are directed to the place which aboundeth in peace, religion and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: ſhe being a Princeſſe trulye accompliſhed with all vertue both morall and intellectuall, with greatnes both of minde and vnderſtanding, and with heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome to gouerne royallye both in peace and warres, to the credit and glory of all her ſexe. God of his mercy maintain her life in much proſperity, euen a whole eternity, that as her vertue is heauenlye and immortall, ſo ſhee her ſelfe may neuer dye, but when the world and all muſt periſh, be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vp to heauen by holye Angels, there to liue in Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory.</p>
